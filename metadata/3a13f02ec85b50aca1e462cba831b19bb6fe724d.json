Their courage and sacrifice made them national heroes but in the 10 years\nsince many have paid a terrible price for their bravery.\n\nThis film tells the story of the close-knit and unusual brotherhood who call themselves 'New\nYork's Bravest', and shows how their bold tradition of rushing into the heart of skyscraper\nfires cost lives - but saved many more.\n\n\nChannel 4 9/11: The Firemen's Story Wed 31 Aug 2011\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://anony.ws/di-3AG6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://anony.ws/di-3AG6.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n::General::\n\nFormat: MPEG-4\nFile Size: 504 MiB\nOverall Bit Rate: 1 485 Kbps\nDuration: 47mn 29s\nSample: NO\nSubtitles: NO\n\n::Video Info::\n\nContainer: avc\nVideo Codec Type: x264\nVideo bitrate Variable: 1 300 Kbps\nResolution: 720 X 400 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR): 16:9\nQuality Factor(QF): 0.181\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps\nSource: (oan).Thanks!!\n\n::Audio Info::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate Mode: Variable\nBitrate: 224 Kbps ((( Stereo )))\nMaximum Bitrate: 576 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count: 2 channels [Front: L R]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a13f02ec85b50aca1e462cba831b19bb6fe724d","amp;dn":"ch4+-+911+The+Firemens+Story+2011+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a13f02ec85b50aca1e462cba831b19bb6fe724d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,19,240,46,200,91,80,172,161,228,98,203,168,49,177,155,182,254,114,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
