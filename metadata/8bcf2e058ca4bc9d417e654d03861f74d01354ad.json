Harassed by gangs and forced to walk the streets for a living, Mary Kelly and her small group of companions trudge on through this daily misery, their only consolation being that things can't get any worse. Yet things somehow do when their friend Ann is kidnapped and they are drawn into a conspiracy with links higher up than they could possibly imagine. The kidnapping is soon followed by the gruesome murder of another woman, Polly, and it becomes apparent that they are being hunted down, one by one. Sinister even by Whitechapel standards, the murder grabs the attention of Inspector Fred Abberline, a brilliant yet troubled man whose police work is often aided by his psychic abilities. Abberline becomes deeply involved with the case, which takes on personal meaning to him when he and Mary begin to fall in love... \n\nDirectors: Albert Hughes, Allen Hughes\nWriters: Alan Moore (graphic novel), Eddie Campbell (graphic novel)\nStars: Johnny Depp, Heather Graham and Ian Holm\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120681/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120681/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFormat: BDAV\nSource: From Hell 2001 Blu-ray US 1080p AVC DTS-HD MA 5.1-Shadowman\nVideo: 1920x1080 at 23.976 fps, MPEG-4 AVC, ~18981 kbps avg\nAudio#1: Russian: 48 kHz, AC3, 3/2 (L,C,R,l,r) + LFE ch, ~448.00 kbps avg |R5|\nAudio#2: Russian: 48 kHz/24-bit, DTS-HD MA 5.1, ~4046.00 kbps avg |\nAudio#3: Russian: 48 kHz, AC3, 3/2 (L,C,R,l,r) + LFE ch, ~384.00 kbps avg |\nAudio#4: Russian: 48 kHz, AC3, 2/0 (L,R) ch, ~192.00 kbps avg \nAudio#5: Russian: 48 kHz/24-bit, DTS-HD MA 5.1, ~4046.00 kbps avg |\nAudio#6: Russian: 48 kHz, DTS, 3/2 (L,C,R,l,r) + LFE ch, ~1536.00 kbps avg |\nAudio#7: English: 48 kHz/24-bit, DTS-HD MA 5.1, ~4046.00 kbps avg \nSubtitles: Russian, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bcf2e058ca4bc9d417e654d03861f74d01354ad","amp;dn":"From.Hell.2001.1080p.BluRay.AVC.REMUX-HDClub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bcf2e058ca4bc9d417e654d03861f74d01354ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,207,46,5,140,164,188,157,65,126,101,77,3,134,31,116,208,19,84,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
