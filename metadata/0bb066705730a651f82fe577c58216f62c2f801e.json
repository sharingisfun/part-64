The announcement was made shortly after the Champions League draw, with the winner pipping team mate Xavi HernÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ndez and Cristiano Ronaldo of Real Madrid to the honour. Iniesta and PiquÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© came fourth and ninth respectively. \n\nSpeaking after collecting the award, Messi said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI want to share this with my colleagues as it is thanks to them that I win these trophies ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ I am very lucky to have such good players at my side and it is them who give me the opportunity to score so many goals. The merit is everyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ He added that the hunger to win among the BarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§a squad is one of the reasons for their ongoing success. \n\nBefore the winner was announced, Xavi showed his usual generosity when saying that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMessi is the best footballer in the world at the momentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, something he has been saying for years. He also felt that FC Barcelona is experiencing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œone of the best moments in its historyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. \n\nThis is just the latest of many awards to have been won by Leo Messi. He has already won a FIFA World Player (2009) and two Ballons dÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Or (2009 and 2010), the last of which was after the two awards were unified. He also been top goalscorer both in Spain and Europe in 2009/10. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI have all my trophies at home, both the individual and team onesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he said. \nFootball News\nSeason 11-12\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bb066705730a651f82fe577c58216f62c2f801e","amp;dn":"Uefa+Best+European+Player+Ceremony","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bb066705730a651f82fe577c58216f62c2f801e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,176,102,112,87,48,166,81,248,47,229,119,197,130,22,246,44,47,128,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
