Many of these authors were virtually unknown to modern audiences, although all of the detectives portrayed had appeared in popular ongoing series of short stories or novels. &quot;Rivals&quot; featured the only dramatizations to date of such period characters as Jacques Futrelle's &quot;The Thinking Machine&quot; and W. H. Hodgson's &quot;Carnacki The Ghost Finder&quot;. Production values were high, although the limitations of early '70's video technology are painfully obvious. The casts included the cream of British television's character actors, featuring a few faces that will be recognizable to American audiences.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167703/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167703/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nEpisode 1: Dr. Thorndyke: A Message from the Deep Sea\nWhen a young woman is stabbed to death in a boarding house of questionable repute, the police quickly settle on their chief suspect.
