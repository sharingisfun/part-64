IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll tell you which films to avoid completely and which ones may warrant 90 minutes of your time.\n\nToday, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Vampire's Kiss\n\nThe dangers of scheduling films for this podcast in advance. What is Vampire's Kiss? Is Nick Cage using an accent, and if so, what kind? Does Cage give the most overly-theatrical performance in film history? Cage's sexual attraction to bats. 1988 Jennifer Beals looks good. What comes first, the vampirism or the schizophrenia? What's the more exploitative exploitation film...Mondo Cane or Vampire's Kiss? Nick Cage knows the alphabet, and I prove it. Will Maria Conchita Alonzo ever find that file? The clip of Nosferatu that Cage's character watches is the best vampire sequence in the film. Cage has the subtlety of all 3 Stooges. Plastic vampire teeth. Is 100 minutes of this shit too much?\n\nFollow these awesome movie-lovin' friends of FoQQ on Twitter...\n@ChadwickGinther @DrunkOnVHS @Mijder @TheWitchsHat @tragedyman @DriveInMob @CulturalGutter","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e8bdf9f773b8c0aa11c7881df6e7b03a5743c4b","amp;dn":"Films+Of+Questionable+Quality+Podcast++E004+Vampire%5C%27s+Kiss","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e8bdf9f773b8c0aa11c7881df6e7b03a5743c4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,139,223,159,119,59,140,10,161,28,120,129,223,110,123,3,165,116,60,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
