It was the brainchild of Frank, Karen and Judy Russell and was initially founded to release stuff by Rheji &amp; Ronald Burrell who have been managed by Frank and Karen at the time.\n\nNugroove, built on the foundation of the Burrell twins who'd escaped from an abortive r'n'b career with Virgin Records, was fast becoming the hippest house label. Nugroove had started the year before with records like Bas Noir's 'My Love Is Magic' and Aphrodisiac's 'Your Love' and by 1989 they were on a roll.\n\n\nCOMPLETE DISCOGRAPHY,\n\nincludes:\n\nBobby Konders\nMassive Sounds\nUnderground Kids\nPower House\nVandal\t\nForemost Poets\nJoey Negro\nCritical Rhythm Featuring Jango Thriller &amp; Vandal\nFrankie Bones &amp; Lenny Dee\n33 1/3 Queen\nProject &quot;86&quot;\nRhythm Masters\n\n\n\n\nThanks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74d999bec9648e389bf73827f830dbc7817c8fc0","amp;dn":"Nu+Groove+Records","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74d999bec9648e389bf73827f830dbc7817c8fc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,217,153,190,201,100,142,56,155,247,56,39,248,48,219,199,129,124,143,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
