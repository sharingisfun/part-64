What you say? Jarvis Humby is actually four blokes? Well then, they've set themselves up to quite a task with a name like that. They even put images of Keith Richards, the Who, the Beatles and a friggin' Union Jack on their album cover. Fortunately, these Humby boys deliver everything they promise. Pure liquid adrenalin R&amp;B, complete with fuzzed guitars, white-boy blues vocals and an omnipresent Hammond that coats everything with a 1964 flavor. &quot;99 Steps to the Sun&quot; could be the official follow-up to ? &amp; the Mysterians' &quot;96 Tears,&quot; but they don't leave it at that. Opener &quot;We Say Yeah!&quot; is excellent if typical garage rock until the closing holler of &quot;Yeah, yeah yeah&quot; that you can imagine soundtracking the toga party scene in Animal House (originally filled by Lloyd Williams' &quot;Shout&quot;). &quot;These Eyes&quot; sounds like R.E.M. sounding like the Byrds, with it's antique 12-string tumble and &quot;The 4th Man&quot; is pure spy show/surf guitar goodness. Coming complete with white pants and Fender reverb, Jarvis Humby will make you want to grow your bangs, pop a couple of pep pills and head on down to Brighton to dance around and fight with the rockers.
