Morgan is attacked by a Koba True had hidden in her back pack and collapses like Commander O'Neill, but Gaal informs them that Koba toxin isn't fatal, and that he is only in a day-long coma. Everyone realizes they have buried Commander O'Neill alive and they rush back to his now empty grave. Gaal says Grendlers must have dug it up and later offers to contact the Grendlers for information about O'Neill. The party meets a Grendler for the first time through Gaal.

Julia enters VR and tells Reilly that Uly is exhibiting Terrian traits. Reilly tells her Uly's change is centered in the pineal gland and instructs her to harvest it for study. Julia agrees to test Uly's spinal fluid but resists the idea of harvesting his pineal gland, but eventually she gives in. After sedating a sleeping Devon and Uly, she takes Uly to an operating site she has set up away from camp. As she begins the incision, a Terrian appears, and Moorish into Alonzo who is holding a heart in his hand. He tells Julia that if she harvests Uly's pineal, they will all die because Uly has become an important link to the evolutionary changes they will have to undergo to survive on the planet.

With each dose of Uly's DNA she grows more and more agitated. She is eventually discovered and has a fight with Devon and throws her off the cliff. Lucky for Julia, the entire fight was in VR.

They ask Julia to prove she didn't reveal their location to the council by talking to Reilly on VR gear with Devon listening in. Reilly tells her to dispose of the bullet as fast as she can. She throws it away from camp just before it explodes. It turns out the shooter is a ZED, a &quot;zero emotional defects&quot;, similar to the Yale program but specialized for killing. Their job is to monitor the exiled prisoners who have been sent to the planet and gather information about them before they die.

Devon and Julia find a cave, used by the Grendlers, which contains some kind of natural transport portal. A Grendler first abducts Julia and takes her through the portal to its cave, where it demands that she supply it with human blood. Meanwhile, Devon, Danzinger, and Alonzo follow through the portal to try to find and rescue Julia. They find themselves on a beach in warm weather and believe they have reached the vicinity of New Pacifica. They later realize that they are actually on the opposite coast from New Pacifica -- 6,000 km in the wrong direction. After they find Julia and try to return, the portal stops functioning. With John's help, Julia realizes that the spiders that have been biting the Grendlers and the colonists are responsible for setting up the portal. There are two types of spiders, one with a positive charge and one with a negative. The positive spiders are on one side of the portal, and the negative on the other.

The next day, the colonists find much of Julia's equipment destroyed and the mutilated body of a Grendler just outside the camp. Returning to the cave dwelling humans they found a few weeks earlier, Devon and Danziger learns that the prehistoric Terrian was the embodiment of all of the evil emotions of the now pacifist Terrians.

After they are rescued by another group from camp, they are haunted by their dreams and a nearby Grendler who reminds them of what lengths they went to in trying to survive while stranded. We then see four scenarios from each of John, Julia, Alonzo and Morgan's point of view of the group eating a Grendler that John in his opinion (and not Alonzo's) killed in self defense. In Julia's story we learn that the Grendler was going to be a mother. True, wanting to communicate with the Grendler's significant other, goes off in the night to talk to him. In the morning when the group finds True missing, they set out armed in search for her. John finds her talking to the Grendler, and when the Grendler sees John armed, he pulls True in front of him for protection. John, thinking True is being held hostage, offers himself for her. The Grendler lets her go, and she tells her father that the Grendler just wanted an explanation of what happened.\n\n121\tFlower Child\n\nPremiered: June 4, 1995\nGuest Stars:\nDirected By: Jim Charleston\nWritten By: Carl Cramer\n\nScouting for food, Danzinger and Bess come across some flowers that spray them with a powder.

The next day, she wanders off towards the north, obsessed with taking the entity within her to a specific location. Although Julia and Morgan catch up with her and try to stop her, she eventually arrives at a deep crevice in the earth. Realizing she will jump, they manage to tie her legs so that she just hangs over the edge. When the powder leaves her body, the crevice explodes in a spray of color and warmth -- Bess has given birth to spring!\n\n122\tAll About Eve\n\nPremiered: May 21, 1995\nGuest Stars: Terry O'Quinn, Christopher Neame, Margaret Gibson\nDirected By: John Harrison\nWritten By: Robert Crais\n\nWhile engaging in a virtual reality program, a strange man appears to Morgan and directs him to take the colonists to a certain nearby location. Morgan program's the colonist's vehicle to stop at the desired location and when they arrive, they find the wreckage of a 50 year old Earth ship. Inside, Morgan activates the mechanism to awaken the still alive occupants of the craft, but only two survive -- a man and a woman who were scientists working for the Council. The survivors are able to diagnose an ailment that is killing the colonists as the result of the malfunction of neural implants that the Earth government placed in the colonists without their knowledge. The scientists also admit that a powerful Earth government computer, named &quot;Eve,&quot; is in orbit around the planet and has been monitoring the colonists' activities through the implants. With the aid of the two scientists, the colonists determine that by establishing an interface between &quot;Eve&quot; and Yale they can correct errors in &quot;Eve's&quot; program. Before the scientists die from the effects of their long cryogenic sleep, they warn the colonists that they will all die because the planet will reject them. Later, after the other colonists have regained their health Devon collapses from an unknown ailment that is related to the planet's rejection of the humans. The colonists then place a near death Devon in a cryogenic chamber in the wrecked craft hoping that it will buy them some time in searching for a way to cure her.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd92b5fd719c626efb459f3526b3a84710c7cde4","amp;dn":"EARTH+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd92b5fd719c626efb459f3526b3a84710c7cde4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,146,181,253,113,156,98,110,251,69,159,53,38,179,168,71,16,199,205,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
