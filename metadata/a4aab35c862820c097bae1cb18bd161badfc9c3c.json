I'll talk to Congressman Paul Ryan about that.\n\nUnions were supposed to be good for workers, but I'll show how union work rules kill prosperity.\n\nI'll report on the new light bulbs you'll soon be forced to use. A new music video mourns the loss of regular light bulbs.\n\nPresidential candidate Gary Johnson is on the show, to explain how the rough treatment he's received from the GOP could result in unintended consequences for Republicans: Johnson running as a third party candidate.\n\nAnd finally, I'll turn to Europe -- where the promises of the central planners have led to a debt crisis that grows worse by the minute.\n\nThe unintended consequences of big government -- That's my show, this week.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4aab35c862820c097bae1cb18bd161badfc9c3c","amp;dn":"20111201-Stossel-%5BUnintended+Consequences%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4aab35c862820c097bae1cb18bd161badfc9c3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,170,179,92,134,40,32,192,151,186,225,203,24,189,22,27,173,252,156,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
