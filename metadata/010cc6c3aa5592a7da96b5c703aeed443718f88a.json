Playing a selection of standards and originals with conviction and energy. In fact, the record is frequently more compelling and exciting than his studio efforts, which tend to sound a bit too clean and studied. Here, he just plays the blues and the results are always engaging.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:010cc6c3aa5592a7da96b5c703aeed443718f88a","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Roy+Book+Binder+-+Don%5C%27t+Start+Me+Talkin%5C%27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"010cc6c3aa5592a7da96b5c703aeed443718f88a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,12,198,195,170,85,146,167,218,150,181,199,3,174,237,68,55,24,248,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
