According to Wikipedia there is an upcoming Suicide Squad set to start sometime this month.  Since I've been on a Deadshot kick I figured I'd upload this.  The original Suicide Squad and the 2001 series are both up on TPB. If they need seeders comment and I can reUL the series.\n\nAlso in terms of Crossgen, I'm going to release a series over the weekend.  Probably Mystic.  I may start splitting the larger series into halves as 400+MB tends to UL very slowly with my internet connection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fae3b05071848ec6f71ee853c398448c0dd84969","amp;dn":"Suicide+Squad+v3+Raise+the+Flag","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fae3b05071848ec6f71ee853c398448c0dd84969","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,227,176,80,113,132,142,198,247,30,232,83,195,152,68,140,13,216,73,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
