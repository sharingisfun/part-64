Moray's musical approach (or gimmick) is to take traditional British folk songs, some well-known (&quot;Barbara Allen&quot;), others more obscure, and create pop arrangements for them using acoustic, electric, and electronic instruments. He sings over those arrangements in an ingenuous, ingratiating tenor that has a timbre reminiscent of Graham Nash. The results are often attractive, though sometimes a bit cute. In his native country, Moray has sometimes been hailed as a big step forward for folk music, generally by people who don't actually like folk music and who use him as a cudgel to beat up on &quot;purists&quot; (i.e., people who actually do like folk music). That isn't his fault, of course, and A Beginners Guide demonstrates that he can be an engaging singer who frequently comes up with entertaining pop settings for traditional compositions, even if he tends largely to eviscerate those compositions in the process.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/05/29/jim-moray/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84641b60bda83e8a70445fd3f0a3a8e2e626f2b1","amp;dn":"Jim+Moray...A+Beginner%5C%27s+Guide%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84641b60bda83e8a70445fd3f0a3a8e2e626f2b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,100,27,96,189,168,62,138,112,68,95,211,240,163,168,226,230,38,242,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
