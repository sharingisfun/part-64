ButlinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Lederhosen Fancy\n\nLau, Bellowhead, Spiers &amp; Boden, Angel Brothers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ besides being folk bands, what these rogueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gallery has in common is that theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re all signed to Derby-based folk label Navigator Records. What Navigator are into is proper, serious folk, which always runs a certain risk of coming across as excessively studious or stale. More than many of the labelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s denizens, Angel Brothers explore on their self-titled album more of a world music feel, taking in some African influences as well as owing some debt to Ennio MorriconeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work in parts, as on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDjangoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s CaravanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, presumably named after CorbucciÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 1966 cult spaghetti western.\n\nWhat makes Angel Brothers a little difficult to get into is the fact that it opens with two folk behemoths ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTongues of FireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGhostsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are well over seven and eight minutes long respectively, and their slowly unraveling appeals will frustrate and bore some listeners, but probably not the kind of listeners who have already found an appreciation for this kind of restrained, sober folk. Angel Brothers arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t flashy or absorbed by spectacle. Like Bellowhead they are content to allow songs to be dominated by delicate acoustic guitar and lengthy English fiddle passages, which on tracks like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEmpty ChairÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ can lend the sound a laid-back, gentle and pastoral feel. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the expected earthy sound here too ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ indeed, testament to the recordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s slightly unpolished and natural feel, the final track ends with some modest overheard dialogue ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œyeah, that was a good oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nWhilst Angel Brothers do a good job of making sure that the disparate types of roots music approached gel together into a fairly cohesive whole, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s those two longer tracks which feel like the core of the album, especially opener ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTongues of FireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Its gradual build is admirable, creating a tense atmosphere which somehow conjures for me at least the mystique and vastness of the desert, aided by some ominous, exotic-sounding strings. Angel Brothers are a bit studious, and this does feel like a serious, considered folk record. But thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not to say that only folk purists will enjoy it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it is certainly, for example, more inviting than Jon BodenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s recent solo album, despite its instrumental nature.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/07/21/the-angel-brothers/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e18985a3dbbc3bab2bd20fd708af87b8d0528df3","amp;dn":"Angel+Brothers...Angel+Brothers%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e18985a3dbbc3bab2bd20fd708af87b8d0528df3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,137,133,163,219,188,59,171,43,210,15,215,8,175,135,184,208,82,141,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
