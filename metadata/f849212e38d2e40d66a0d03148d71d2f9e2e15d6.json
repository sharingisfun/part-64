It was supposed to be an archeologically and historically promotional CD and not to be used for the popular market. It contains constructions of Roman and Gallo-Roman music. At this point Omnia was a theatre group (combat and ritual performances) of 8 to 14 people.\n\nThe CD is a collectors' item since there were only 150 pieces released.\n\nFor the recording, crystals where placed in the microphones. This unique concept was developed by Norbert Veel (Liessel, NL). It gives a &quot;unique sonic and emotional fidelity unknown in most modern recordings&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f849212e38d2e40d66a0d03148d71d2f9e2e15d6","amp;dn":"Sine+Missione+-+1Ste+Editie+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f849212e38d2e40d66a0d03148d71d2f9e2e15d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,73,33,46,56,210,228,13,102,160,208,49,72,215,29,47,158,46,21,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
