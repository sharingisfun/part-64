This episode, our driving delinquents begin by attempting to manoeuvre and park a huge tow trailer. Next, the drivers head up a ramp into a large circle and attempt the Three Point Turn Challenge. This should be easy as 1- 2- 3... but remember, we are dealing with Canada's Worst Drivers.\n\nFinally, they buckle up and head to the annual Water Tank Challenge -- a task that may dampen some dreams of graduating. As our drivers towel off, our panel of experts make their decision. Another driver heads home and we continue the search for Canada's Worst Driver.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3af92526e7d0a713c70a97c322c863e94b9f7a4","amp;dn":"Canada%5C%27s+Worst+Driver+S07E04","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3af92526e7d0a713c70a97c322c863e94b9f7a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,175,146,82,110,125,10,113,60,112,169,124,50,44,134,62,148,185,247,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
