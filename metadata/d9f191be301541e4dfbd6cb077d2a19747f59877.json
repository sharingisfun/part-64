I have edited out the  \nmusic played during the commercial breaks.\n\nNotes: Doc Thompson in for Beck.  On the 29th Glenn &amp; crew said they were on vacation next week.  I haven't decided yet if I will be uploading yet - stay tuned!\n\nOn another note, today marks the end of six solid months of capturing, editing and uploading Glenn Beck's webcast of his Radio show.  I hope you've enjoyed it!  To all those that have said &quot;thanks&quot; in all of the various posts you are very welcome.  Thanks for all those that continue to seed after downloading!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9f191be301541e4dfbd6cb077d2a19747f59877","amp;dn":"Glenn+Beck+2011-07-01+%28Radio+Web+Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9f191be301541e4dfbd6cb077d2a19747f59877","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,241,145,190,48,21,65,228,223,189,108,176,119,210,161,151,71,245,152,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
