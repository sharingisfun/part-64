But the question is, will Canada's worst drivers be able to plow their way through the challenge? Then, we find out what our drivers know about everyday rules of the road. The results will surprise you. Later, our drivers slide over to the curling ice and try their hand at Car Curling.\n\nUsing all they've learnt in rehab so far, they must deliver the best draw weight so the stone reaches the house. Finally, with training under their belts, they attempt the Moose Evasive Challenge. \n\nOne driver heads back to the public roads after showing an improvement and our experts continue to watch closely to determine who will be Canada's Worst Driver.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:825dcad3665e1bf74c4b46be66485fa070b1142f","amp;dn":"Canada%5C%27s+Worst+Driver+S07E06","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"825dcad3665e1bf74c4b46be66485fa070b1142f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,93,202,211,102,94,27,247,76,75,70,190,102,72,95,160,112,177,20,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
