The full set has not been broadcast complete, this is edited together (almost) seamlessly from two different broadcasts.\n\n\nSetlist:\n\t1.\tThe Birds *ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n\t2.\tThe Bones of You ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n\t3.\tMirrorball ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n\t4.\tNeat Little Rows ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n\t5.\tGrounds for Divorce ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n\t6.\tThe Loneliness of a Tower Crane Driver ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n\t7.\tLippy Kids *ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n\t8.\tWeather to Fly * ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n\t9.\tOpen Arms *ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n\t10.\tOne Day Like This *\n\n\nSongs marked * are from the BBC Four recording, with slight artefacts on the picture, due to a bad DVD recording. Audio is unaffected.\n\nThe other songs are from the BBC Three live broadcast and so contain the between-song banter!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:856cd3f94de7cfb2a0e529ef0d83f6961645bcfe","amp;dn":"Elbow+at+Glastonbury+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"856cd3f94de7cfb2a0e529ef0d83f6961645bcfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,108,211,249,77,231,207,178,160,229,41,239,13,131,246,150,22,69,188,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
