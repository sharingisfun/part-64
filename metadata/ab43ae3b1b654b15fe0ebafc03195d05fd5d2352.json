This is just materials the game requires, not the full game.\n\nExtract rar(s) to C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/YOUR-USERNAME/garrysmod/garrysmod/ (yes, two garrysmods. They go in the same folder as the other materials/maps/etc folders).\n\nComments or questions? Please post on this page.\n\nPS: If you still get error boxes after installing this, then either you installed it incorrectly, or it's a custom material that the server owner needs to send you.\n\n\nContained content files:\nCounter Strike: Source,\nDay of Defeat: Source,\nHalf Life 2: Episode 1,\nHalf Life 2: Episode 2,\nHalf Life: Source,\nHalf Life Deathmatch: Source,\nPortal.\n\nNOT included content:\nHalf Life 2: Lost Coast - Free game.\nTeam Fortress 2 - Free game.\nZombie Panic! Source - Free game.\nL4D1/2 - Could not find the materials in any GCF, sorry.\nThe other small mods / anything not on above list.\n\n\n\nGood luck, have fun, enjoy, and seed please!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab43ae3b1b654b15fe0ebafc03195d05fd5d2352","amp;dn":"Garrysmod+Shared+Materials+%28Fix+Red+Errors%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab43ae3b1b654b15fe0ebafc03195d05fd5d2352","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,67,174,59,27,101,75,21,254,14,186,252,3,25,93,5,253,93,35,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
