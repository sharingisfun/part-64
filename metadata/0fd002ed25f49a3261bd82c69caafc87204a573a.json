The unified theory follows an innovative approach ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ that of combining all signal classes into just one. The fundamental signal operations (convolution, Fourier transform, linear systems, sampling and interpolation) are established simultaneously for all the signal classes. This unified approach avoids the repetition of similar concepts consequent on other approachesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ separate treatment of definitions and properties for each signal class. Modern wavelet ideas are developed in harmony with the rest of the text. Unified Signal Theory provides: \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ exercises and examples, to give the student practice;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ solutions which are available for download and save the tutor time; and \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ a choice of two suggested reading paths depending on the level of the student, for an enhanced learning experience. \nThe advantages of the unified approach are many: it permits a global vision of the topic, it is economical in teaching and learning, and it can be adjusted easily to fit new applications. This textbook presents the theory in five chapters, and goes on to demonstrate specific applications such as fast Fourier transform implementation, sampling and reconstructions of signals, and multicolor modulation systems, in a further six chapters. Mathematical concepts are introduced conceptually within the body of the book with more rigorous treatment being reserved for the appendices.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fd002ed25f49a3261bd82c69caafc87204a573a","amp;dn":"Unified+Signal+Theory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fd002ed25f49a3261bd82c69caafc87204a573a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,208,2,237,37,244,154,50,97,189,130,198,156,170,252,135,32,74,87,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
