In fact, the very spirit of BLACK AND WHITE AMERICA\n     came from the locations in which the music was madeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹from a tiny, 400\n     -person community in the Bahamas to the streets of Paris. And out of\n     his experiences as a true citizen of the planet, his first new songs\n     in three years became the most personal and diverse collection of his\n     career. &quot;No doubt, my environment definitely lends a lot to the\n     creative process,&quot; he says.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5b9d9b33f68238027dfbaa46219624332e62d98","amp;dn":"Lenny_Kravitz_-_Black_And_White_America-2011-MOD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5b9d9b33f68238027dfbaa46219624332e62d98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,185,217,179,63,104,35,128,39,223,186,164,98,25,98,67,50,230,45,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
