PUBLIC means everyone can have it, so we haven`t included any fancy team secrets like very special shadercodes. ALPHA means it`s not in the stage for balancing and final beta testing, still some polishing to do. However, it can be played till the levels end both shooter style and tinker way. CUT means we have taken out some things that would spoiler too much from the previous levels: - The Mission Log described here: has been removed, all necessary hints are provided as voice overs. - Enemy types have been reduced to 1 enemy ty, as the others in this level are not yet announced. - Cutscenes are substituted with nightvision sequences as the movie cutscenes aren`t shot yet - 2 puzzles have been removed as they rely on skills and informations from the previous levels\n\n\n\nAll about the TECH-SPEC:\n\nScreen Resolution:\n\nis set to 1680*1050, as this turned out to run fluently on mid-range machines.\nIf your monitor doesn`t support that or you want to go higher, open the setup.ini here and look for\n\nwidth=1680\nheight=1050\n\nin the [Gamedebug] section.\n\nReplace with\n\nwidth=1024\nheight=768\n\nOR\n\nwidth=1280\nheight=800\n\nor any other resolution supported by your system.
