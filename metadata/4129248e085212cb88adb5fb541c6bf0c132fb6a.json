Their vocalists have harmonized, crooned and growled together for over thirty years. Time is kept with brushed snare, washboard, clay udu or spoons. At the bottom of the sound is the tuba, which can be regal or downright flatulent. Whether they play rural blues, ballads, ragtime, jug-band, New Orleans style or R&amp;B, it all has a funky, barrel-house feel. Artists covered by the band range from Memphis Minnie, to Etta James, and Robert Johnson, to Ry Cooder. Ironbound Blues, a recent CD release from The Booglerizers, presents nine original songs with music and lyrics composed by Richard DiPaolo, and six eclectic covers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4129248e085212cb88adb5fb541c6bf0c132fb6a","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Booglerizers+-+Ironbound+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4129248e085212cb88adb5fb541c6bf0c132fb6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,41,36,142,8,82,18,203,136,173,181,251,84,28,107,240,193,50,251,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
