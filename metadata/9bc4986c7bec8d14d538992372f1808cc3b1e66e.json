He is from Manchester, UK but now lives in Prague, Czech Republic. This album is truly very different from what the market offers these days. But not different in the way that would make it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œunlistenable&quot;, quite the opposite. The album contains thirteen songs and it won't be an exaggeration when I say that they all are absolutely brilliant. They all feature amazing vocals, very clever lyrics (you feel you could have written some of them yourself ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ even though you probably couldn't...) and interesting guitar playing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ both acoustic and electric. What I really like about the lyrics is that there are almost like poems, there are many different ways of how to interpret them. I have tried asking my friends about their understanding of the songs and it was interesting to hear so many different views.\n\nThe album was released by what seems like a small independent label. (Dekkor Records).\n\nThe cover and the booklet: interesting piece of art work by Paul Wilson, try to study the picture for a few minutes and you will see a lot of different things ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦The booklet is very simple and does not contain any lyrics which I am sure some fans will miss. But if you put the CD on, I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think you will be interested in reading the usual small print lyrics anyway.\n\nNow the musicians:\n\nLyrics: James Harries (Except Ghost Town, written by Jimmy Bozeman\nVocals: James Harries\nBacking Vocals: Marta Topferova and Lenka Dusilova\nAcoustic Guitar: James Harries\nElectric Guitars: James Harries and Gawain Mathews\nBaritone Guitar: Gawain Mathews\nDrums: Scott Amendola and Joe Bagale\nPercussion: Michael Spiro\nBass: Jon Evans and Jeff Allen\nViolin: Irene Sayer\nViola: Dina Maccabe\nCello: Marika Hughes\nString arrangements: Ben Yonas and Stuart Bogie\nPiano, Harmonium, Wurlitzer, Mellotron, Organ, Casio: Ben Yonas\nClarinets and Harmonica: Stuart Bogie\nTrumpet and Flugel Horn: Mike Olmos\nCuatro: Marta Topferova\nTrombone: Adam Theis\nAdditional Sound Design: Joe Bagale\n\nWow, so many different instruments and musicians yet this album still has a feeling of simplicity, not overproduced and over arranged, it feels real, as if the band was playing live.\n\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2010/11/21/james-harries/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bc4986c7bec8d14d538992372f1808cc3b1e66e","amp;dn":"James+Harries...Days+Like+These%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bc4986c7bec8d14d538992372f1808cc3b1e66e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,196,152,108,123,236,141,20,213,56,153,35,114,241,128,140,195,177,230,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
