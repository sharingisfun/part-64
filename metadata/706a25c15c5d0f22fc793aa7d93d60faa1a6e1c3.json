I believe this is the same\n                   show as &quot;Bin Laden: Shoot to Kill&quot; released by C4TV from PDTV source, only the History Channel version \n                   has an extra 12mins of footage and is from HDTV source. \n\nDescription......: Featuring exclusive interviews with President Barack Obama and other senior aides, this two-hour special \n                   event will take viewers inside the dedicated effort to hunt and kill Osama Bin Laden. We'll also examine \n                   the historical ramifications for President Obama's administration, as well as look at the role of the \n                   men and women who worked for many years over several administrations to make this possible. Rigorously \n                   researched, Targeting Bin Laden uses historical footage, photographs and dramatic re-enactments to \n                   illustrate one of the most important missions in our nation's history. In addition to President Obama, \n                   interviewees include National Security Advisor, Tom Donilon; White House Chief Counter-Terrorism \n                   Advisor, John O. Brennan; Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications; \n                   former CIA Director, Gen. Michael Vincent Hayden; former CIA Deputy Director of Counter-Terrorism, \n                   Philip Mudd; members of Congress; policy experts and others.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:706a25c15c5d0f22fc793aa7d93d60faa1a6e1c3","amp;dn":"History.Channel.Targeting.Bin.Laden.HDTV.XviD-DiVERGE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"706a25c15c5d0f22fc793aa7d93d60faa1a6e1c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,106,37,193,92,93,15,34,252,121,58,167,217,61,96,250,161,166,225,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
