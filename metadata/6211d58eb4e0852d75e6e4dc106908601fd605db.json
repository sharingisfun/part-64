It is still under development, but an initial testing release is already available. Our aim is to create a light linux distribution, which is simple, up-to-date, fast and user friendly and which follows the K.I.S.S principle. We are using the Desktop Environment Xfce, which is light but powerfull. Arch Linux is a great GNU/Linux distribution, but installing and configuring it, needs some time and experience. So we improved Arch Linux. We created a more user friendly installation process, wrote bash scripts for managing graphic drivers, configured xfce with some useful functions and a GUI settings manager is also planed. Just try it. ;)\n\n# Changelog for Manjaro Linux Version 0.1.1\n# Released on the 14 July 2011\n\nManjaro Linux:\n\tIf a package update was applied, then manjaro's filesystem package was   deinstalled\n\tPrint an infobox with current passwords\n\tFixed this error message on boot '/bin/chown: invalid group: root:utmp'\n\tRemoved package samba\n\tReplace balsa with thunderbird\n\tInstalled gnumeric\n\tIf the architecture is x86_64, then add the multilib repo to pacman.conf\n\tAdded 3G support\n\tAdded conky\n\tUpdated /etc/readahead.d/ config files\n\tFixed some language problems\n\tFixed Groups error\n\nmanjaro-installer:\n\tInstaller crashed on Systems with extended partitions.
