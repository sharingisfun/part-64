A large, persistent city acts as the gameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lobby where players can form gangs, accept missions and buy new weapons. The game consists of seven game modes, which can be broken down into two major categories: PvP game modes, wherein players compete against each other, and PvE game modes, wherein players compete against computer controlled AI bots. Other features include questing, achievements, crafting and gang hideouts. \n\nLobbies is where players spend their time when they are not in combat instances. Hundreds of players can be in a lobby at once. From here, players have a good choice as to what they would like to do. Players are able to talk to one another through chat, and barter items with one another. Players can also join groups, as well as gangs, which are equivalent to Guilds or Clans. Players are able to talk to numerous Non-Player-Characters that are spread throughout all three lobbies. Players can either buy in-game items from them, or complete quests. Players can craft items such as weapons, clothing, and drugs. Players are able to choose from a large list of abilities, boosts, equipment each with different pros and cons. These items can be used in the instanced battles.\nInstall,create account,and play\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ecf6a8774cf283f719fc824139649ecb1af5773","amp;dn":"Crimecraft-Bleedout","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ecf6a8774cf283f719fc824139649ecb1af5773","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,207,106,135,116,207,40,63,113,159,200,36,19,150,73,236,177,175,87,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
