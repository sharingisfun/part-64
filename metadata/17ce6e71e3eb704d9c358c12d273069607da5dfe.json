Compilation and remastering of the tracks took place in New York during early-to-mid 1990. A 30-page booklet was included for the vinyl and CD releases.\n\nThis boxed set contains two previously-unreleased tracks and a new mix. &quot;Travelling Riverside Blues&quot; was recorded on 24 June 1969 at the BBC Maida Vale Studio. &quot;White Summer&quot; was recorded at the Playhouse Theatre, London on 27 June 1969. The &quot;Moby Dick&quot;/&quot;Bonzo's Montreux&quot; mix took place at the Atlantic Synclavier Suite in New York, in May 1990.\n\nTo differentiate this release from the future Remasters box sets, some world recording industry associations have listed this under the title The Complete Collection (not to be confused with the later 1993 release The Complete Studio Recordings).\n\nIn an interview he gave in January 2010, Page made reference to the Boxed Set:\n\nOh, I'm now fully aware of the mark Led Zeppelin made on the musical landscape. My awareness was re-heightened when we were remastering the material to do that CD box set in 1990. When you hear it all, song after song, you realise what a textbook it is for musicians who are coming along, and that's so great. The whole thing is about passing it on, because that's how it was done for me when I was learning from all those old blues and rockabilly records. It's all part of how this cultural phenomenon keeps moving on. I think everyone carries the flame on.[1]\n\nContents\nTrack listing\nSide one\nNo. Title Writer(s) Length\n1. &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; (from Led Zeppelin II, 1969) Bonham, Jones, Page, Plant, Dixon 5:34\n2. &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; (from Led Zeppelin II, 1969) Bonham, Jones, Page, Plant 4:14\n3. &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; (from Led Zeppelin, 1969) Bonham, Jones, Page 2:29\n4. &quot;Babe I'm Gonna Leave You&quot; (from Led Zeppelin, 1969) Bredon, Page, Plant 6:42\n5. &quot;What Is and What Should Never Be&quot; (from Led Zeppelin II, 1969) Page, Plant 4:47\nSide two\nNo. Title Writer(s) Length\n1. &quot;Thank You&quot; (from Led Zeppelin II, 1969) Page, Plant 4:50\n2. &quot;I Can't Quit You Baby (live 9 January 1970)&quot; (from Coda, 1982) Dixon 4:43\n3. &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; (from Led Zeppelin, 1969) Page 6:27\n4. &quot;Your Time Is Gonna Come&quot; (from Led Zeppelin, 1969) Jones, Page 4:41\n5. &quot;Ramble On&quot; (from Led Zeppelin II, 1969) Page, Plant 4:23\nSide three\nNo. Title Writer(s) Length\n1. &quot;Travelling Riverside Blues (live at the BBC 24 June 1969)&quot; (previously unreleased, 1969) Johnson, Page, Plant 5:11\n2. &quot;Friends&quot; (from Led Zeppelin III, 1970) Page, Plant 3:55\n3. &quot;Celebration Day&quot; (from Led Zeppelin III, 1970) Jones, Page, Plant 3:29\n4. &quot;Hey Hey What Can I Do&quot; (appeared on b-side to &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; single, 1970) Bonham, Jones, Page, Plant 3:55\n5. &quot;White Summer/Black Mountain Side&quot; (recorded 1969) Page 8:01\nSide four\nNo. Title Writer(s) Length\n1. &quot;Black Dog&quot; (from Led Zeppelin IV, 1971) Jones, Page, Plant 4:55\n2. &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; (from Houses of the Holy, 1973) Page, Plant 4:50\n3. &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; (from Led Zeppelin III, 1970) Page, Plant 2:27\n4. &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; (from Led Zeppelin IV, 1971) Page, Plant 5:52\n5. &quot;Bron-Y-Aur Stomp&quot; (from Led Zeppelin III, 1970) Jones, Page, Plant 4:20\n6. &quot;Tangerine&quot; (from Led Zeppelin III, 1970) Page 3:12\nSide five\nNo. Title Writer(s) Length\n1. &quot;Going to California&quot; (from Led Zeppelin IV, 1971) Page, Plant 3:31\n2. &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot; (from Led Zeppelin III, 1970) Jones, Page, Plant 7:24\n3. &quot;D'yer Mak'er&quot; (from Houses of the Holy, 1973) Bonham, Jones, Page, Plant 4:23\n4. &quot;Gallows Pole&quot; (from Led Zeppelin III, 1970) trad., arr.
