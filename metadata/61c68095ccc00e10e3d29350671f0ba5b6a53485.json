The arrival of a German rocket scientist is not initially welcomed by the inhabitants of the island.\n\nThe film was shot in 2001, but its release was delayed by several years.[2] Additional footage was shot in 2005, and the film was given a limited release in Scotland the following year.\n\nThe story is very loosely based on experiments in 1934 by German inventor Gerhard Zucker to provide a postal service to the island of Scarp by rocket mail.[3] Another fictionalised account of the experiment formed the basis of a 2001 film, also called The Rocket Post, which was filmed on Taransay.[4] The film\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s original score was composed by Nigel Clarke &amp; Michael Csanyi-Wills and recorded by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London.\n\nThe Rocket Post (2004) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337708/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61c68095ccc00e10e3d29350671f0ba5b6a53485","amp;dn":"The.Rocket.Post.%282006%29.LiMiTED.DVDRip+CD1-CD2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61c68095ccc00e10e3d29350671f0ba5b6a53485","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,198,128,149,204,192,14,16,227,210,147,80,103,31,11,165,182,165,52,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
