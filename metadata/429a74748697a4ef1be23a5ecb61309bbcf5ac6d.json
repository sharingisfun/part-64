One night, she sees that the front door is slightly ajar and impulsively decides to sneak inside. But there in the dark, decrepit auditorium, a show unlike any other unfolds before her eyes. Its host is an eerie human puppet named Peg Poett who will introduce Penny to six tales of the bizarre: A couple traveling in a remote part of the French Pyrenees cross paths with a lustful witch; A paranoid lover faces the wrath of a partner who has been pushed to her limit; The Freudian dreams of an unfaithful husband blur the lines between fantasy and reality; The horrors of the real world are interpreted through the mind of a child; A woman addicted to other peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s memories gets her fix through the vitreous fluid of her victimsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ eyeballs; And a perverse obsession with sweets turns sour for a couple in too deepÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ \n\nGenre: Horror \nIMDB rating: 5.7/10 from 169 users \nDirected by: Douglas Buck, Buddy Giovinazzo, and 5 more \nStarring: Udo Kier, Virginia Newcomb and Amanda Marquardt \n\nRelease Name: The.Theater.Bizarre.2011.DVDSCR.AC3-2.0.XviD-SiC \nSize: 1.65 GB \nVideo: XviD , 720ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€320, 1 877 Kbps \nAudio: English, AC3, 192 Kbps \nRuntime: 1h 53mn\n                                      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:429a74748697a4ef1be23a5ecb61309bbcf5ac6d","amp;dn":"The.Theater.Bizarre.2011.DVDSCR.AC3-2.0.XviD-SiC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"429a74748697a4ef1be23a5ecb61309bbcf5ac6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,154,116,116,134,151,164,239,27,226,58,94,203,97,48,155,188,245,172,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
