(40000ft)\n\n- The MIG-23ML armed with two R-23 Apex, now reaches from 600km/h to 900km/h in 12.2 seconds at 3000ft, same as the real ML, and from 1.00M to 2.00M\nin about 160 seconds (2 minutes and 40 seconds) at an altitude of 36000ft\n\n- The MIG-29's = 2.35M\n\n- The MIG-31 = 2.8M (above 70000ft)\n\n- The Su-27/30/37 = 2.35M\n\n- The Su-32 = 1.8M (36000ft)\n\n- The Su-33 = 2.17M (33000ft)\n\n- The Su-35 = 2.25M\n\n- The SR-71 = M3.2+ at around 80000ft\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe following aircrafts now have a better Cobra and Kulbit/Powerloop behaviour:\n\n- MIG-29 all variants\n\n- Su-27/30's/32/33/35/37\n\n- The F-22 Raptor\n\n***Although the Cobra ability for MIG-29 and Su-27/30 is now closer to real, there is a small issue with the rudders going in opposite direction when\napplied somewhere between 200-300kts, because of the limitations within the .dat files..., but this shouldn't affect the landing speed or cause any\ndifficulties in any way!***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nThank you for choosing the Realism Patch of Open Falcon for a higher level of accuracy and performance...!\n\n&quot;Always looking towards a better Falcon!&quot;\n\n\nGreetings...!\n\n\t&quot;Falconeers&quot;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcc24a64e91a91cec091ebe8e8ebf39edfe14d3a","amp;dn":"Open+Falcon+4.7%5C%27s+Realism+Patch+V2.15OF.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcc24a64e91a91cec091ebe8e8ebf39edfe14d3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,194,74,100,233,26,145,206,192,145,235,232,232,235,243,158,223,225,77,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
