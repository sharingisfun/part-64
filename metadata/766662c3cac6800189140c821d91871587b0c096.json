A group called Direct Action claims responsibility.\n\nOctober 14th, 1982: a truck explodes outside the Litton Industries plant in Rexdale, ON, where guidance systems for the cruise missile were manufactured, resulting in millions of dollars in damages. Direct Action again claims responsibility.\n\nNovember 22nd, 1982: three locations of Red Hot Video - a store specializing in violent bootleg pornography - were firebombed. A group calling themselves the Wimmin's Fire Brigade claims responsibility.\n\nAnn Hansen, along with four others, who became to be known as the Squamish 5, eventually stood trial for these acts and was sentenced to life in prison. She served seven years.\n\nRecorded in October 2002, Ann Hansen reflects on the successes and failures of the bombings, and dispels some of the common myths surrounding not only her actions, but armed struggle in general. She also explores the differences between direct action and terrorism as means of affecting social change; laying the groundwork for defining what direct action means, what its guiding principles are, and how it can be applied successfully and meaningfully in today's political climate.\n\nRunning Time: 55:00\n\n1  One Struggle, Many Fronts \n2  Basic Principles of Direct Action\n3  Terrorism in the Age of Double-Speak\n4  Many Shades of Grey\n5  Capitalism &amp; Control of Society\n6  Property Destruction\n7  The Urgency of the Movement\n8  Direct Action and Other Models\n9  The Litton Bombing: Results, Reactions\n10 The Wimmin's Fire Brigade\n11 By Any Means Necessary\n12 &quot;Collateral Damage?&quot;\n13 Reflections on Prison\n14 Organizing in Prison\n15 Prisoner Support Network\n16 The Trial\n17 Why Should We Care?\n18 Counter-Productive?\n19 Guiding Principles for Direct Action\n20 Can Assassinations Be Justified?\n21 Repression as a Catalyst for Action\n22 Disclaimer\n23 Weaknesses of the Vancouver 5\n24 What Can We Do?\n25 Self-Defence\n26 The Red Hot Video Arrests\n27 Working Within the System\n28 A Question of Consent\n29 A Final Reflection on Tactics\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.g7welcomingcommittee.com/discography/g7031.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.g7welcomingcommittee.com/discography/g7031.php&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:766662c3cac6800189140c821d91871587b0c096","amp;dn":"Direct+Action+Reflections+on+Armed+Resistance+and+the+Squamish+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"766662c3cac6800189140c821d91871587b0c096","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,102,98,195,202,198,128,1,137,20,12,130,29,145,135,21,135,176,192,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
