It was written and produced by Dee Dee Halligan (Tony Hendrik/Dieter LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼nstedt) and Junior Torello (Karin Hartman-EisenblÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤tter) of Coconut Records in Cologne. Recorded in the early 1990s, it later experienced a revival as the song from the Saturday Night Live *Roxbury Guys* sketches, where two brothers played by Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell frequently went to dance clubs. The sketches were later made into the 1998 feature film A Night at the Roxbury.\n\nThe song peaked at number two in the United Kingdom and Germany, but it reached number one in 13 other countries, all of them European or Asian. In the United States the song reached number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number 12 in Australia. The song is currently the 62nd best-selling single of all time in Germany.\n\nAbout Nestor Haddaway:The son of a Dutch oceanographer and a Trinidadian nurse, Haddaway moved from Trinidad to Europe in the early 1970s with his father when his parents separated. After spending his formative years at boarding school, he moved to the United States to be with his mother.\n\nHis high school years were spent in Maryland City, Maryland, where he graduated from Meade Senior High School in 1983. While at Meade, he was very active in the school's jazz, marching, symphonic, and stage bands.\n\nDiscovering a love for music, Haddaway performed small engagements with a cover band called *Chance* while he studied political science and history at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1989, then aged 24, Haddaway returned to Europe and settled in Cologne, Germany, where he started playing American football for the Cologne Crocodiles in the German Football League, as well as working as a choreographer, selling carpets and making music in his spare time.\n\nMusical career\n==============\nHaddaway's break came in 1992 when he was signed by German label Coconut Records. His first single *What Is Love* rapidly became popular across Europe, reaching number 2 in Germany and in the United Kingdom, where it sold more than 500,000 copies. It later reached number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. In the music video, there is a cameo of Coralie AzaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯s, his girlfriend at this time.\n\nHis second single *Life* hit number 2 in Germany, number 6 in the UK and number 41 in the USA; *I Miss You* and *Rock My Heart* were also top 10 smashes across Europe and established him as a successful Eurodance artist. His first LP The Album was also a multi-million seller.\n\nIn 1995, he released his second album The Drive, which spawned the UK top 20 hit *Fly Away*, as well as *Catch a Fire* and *Lover Be Thy Name*.\n\nSubsequent albums are more soulful, but since 1998, Haddaway has struggled to repeat the mainstream commercial success of his early hits.\n\nHaddaway appeared on the Comeback reality television show in Germany in 2004. He appeared on a similar UK show, Hit Me Baby One More Time, in 2005 and subsequently appeared on the U.S. version. This exposure led to him scoring a moderate chart hit in Germany with the ballad *Spaceman*.\n\n*What Is Love* enjoyed a resurge in popularity as the theme music for the head bobbing, nightclubbing addicted Butabi brothers (Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan) on Saturday Night Live and the subsequent film A Night at the Roxbury. The song was also featured in a 2008 PEPSI commercial (for diet Pepsi Max) which parodied the Leitmotif and included several stars including LL Cool J, Missy Elliot, and Busta Rhymes, but interestingly not Haddaway.\n\nWhat Is Love Lyrics\n===================\nWhat is love?\nBaby, don't hurt me\nDon't hurt me no more\nBaby don't hurt me\nDon't hurt me no more\n\nWhat is love?\nYeah\n\nI don't know why you're not there\nI give you my love but you don't care\nSo what is right and what is wrong?\nGimme a sign\n\nWhat is love\nBaby, don't hurt me\nDon't hurt me no more\nWhat is love?\nBaby, don't hurt me\nDon't hurt me no more\n\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, uh, uh\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, uh, uh\n\nOh, I don't know, what can I do?\nWhat else can I say, it's up to you\nI know we're one, just me and you\nI can't go on\n\nWhat is love?\nBaby, don't hurt me\nDon't hurt me no more\nWhat is love?\nBaby, don't hurt me\nDon't hurt me no more\n\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, uh, uh\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, uh, uh\n\nWhat is love?\nWhat is love?\nWhat is love?\nBaby, don't hurt me\nDon't hurt me no more\n\nDon't hurt me\nDon't hurt me\n\nI want no other, no other lover\nThis is our life, our time\nWe are together, I need you forever\nIs it love?\n\nWhat is love?\nBaby, don't hurt me\nDon't hurt me no more\nWhat is love?\nBaby, don't hurt me\nDon't hurt me no more\n\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, uh, uh\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, uh, uh\n\nWhat is love?\nBaby, don't hurt me\nDon't hurt me no more\nWhat is love?\nBaby, don't hurt me\nDon't hurt me no more\n\nBaby, don't hurt me\nDon't hurt me no more\nBaby, don't hurt me\nDon't hurt me no more\nWhat is love?\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nTO ALL MY SEEDERS,\n  \n    WITH ALL MY LOVE *HYPERDRIVE25*\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab30efb0678c428776ea45e8bd8aa9b0b88445cc","amp;dn":"Haddaway-What+Is+Love+%5BHyperdrive25%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab30efb0678c428776ea45e8bd8aa9b0b88445cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,48,239,176,103,140,66,135,118,234,69,232,189,138,169,176,184,132,69,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
