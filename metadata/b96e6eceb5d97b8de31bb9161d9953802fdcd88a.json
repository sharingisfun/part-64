Inspired primarily by a sketch of stylized wingless birds, the game was first released for Apple's iOS in December 2009.[2] Since that time, over 12 million copies of the game have been purchased from Apple's App Store,[3] which has prompted the company to design versions for other touchscreen-based smartphones, such as those using the Android operating system, among others.\n\nIn the game, players use a slingshot to launch birds at pigs stationed on or within various structures, with the intent of destroying all the pigs on the playfield. As players advance through the game, new birds appear, some with special abilities that can be activated by the player. Rovio Mobile has supported Angry Birds with numerous free updates that add additional game content, and the company has even released \nstand-alone holiday and promotional versions of the game.\n\n\n\n .d888                   888    d8b 888             888      \nd88P&quot;                    888    Y8P 888             888      \n888                      888        888             888      \n888888 888  888 .d8888b  888888 888 888888 88888b.  88888b.  \n888    888  888 88K      888    888 888    888 &quot;88b 888 &quot;88b \n888    888  888 &quot;Y8888b. 888    888 888    888  888 888  888 \n888    Y88b 888      X88 Y88b.  888 Y88b.  888 d88P 888 d88P \n888     &quot;Y88888  88888P'  &quot;Y888 888  &quot;Y888 88888P&quot;  88888P&quot;  \n                                           888               \n                                           888               \n                                           888               \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b96e6eceb5d97b8de31bb9161d9953802fdcd88a","amp;dn":"Angry+Birds+Seasons+2.1.0+%28Portable%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b96e6eceb5d97b8de31bb9161d9953802fdcd88a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,110,110,206,181,217,123,141,227,27,185,22,29,153,83,128,47,220,216,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
