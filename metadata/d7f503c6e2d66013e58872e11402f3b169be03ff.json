Thus the extensive tribute to Crass in &quot;Do You Believe&quot;. Cult of Youth and Thulsa Doom played prior. Recording was somewhat less than optimal, both main cams were running out of juice hence the split, and the use of the Lumix still camera as a back up. The Lumix, with no image stabilization wacks out of focus to the bass. The sound feed from the board was naff, so it's a Zoom H1 I had at the side of the room mixed with a bit of camera. There is occasional peak distortion crackle.\n\nThe dvd is authored such that there is the option to 1) play all, 2) play songs only, 3) select songs. I've included a couple of framegrabs and a label.\n\nSinger John Robb has requested that I make this freely available, and says he has no problem with it being sold anywhere. He can be contacted via facebook or the band's website to confirm.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://goldblade.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://goldblade.com&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7f503c6e2d66013e58872e11402f3b169be03ff","amp;dn":"Goldblade+2011-05-08+Santos+Party+House%2C+New+York+City+PUNKCAST+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7f503c6e2d66013e58872e11402f3b169be03ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,245,3,198,226,214,96,19,229,136,114,225,20,2,243,177,105,190,3,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
