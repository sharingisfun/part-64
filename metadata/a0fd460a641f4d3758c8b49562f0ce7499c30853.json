The initial order of locomotives, designated 37-Class, were delivered with 36 inch dynamic brakes and horizontal grilles, and were numbered 37LABC through 41LABC.\n\nSanta Fes 300-Class locomotives, delivered in October 1949, were identical in appearance to the 37-Class units, except they were configured in 3-unit A-B-B sets, numbered 300LAB through 305LAB. That these were 3-unit sets was the only reason why these locomotives were assigned a separate class.\n\nIncluded with the ATSF 37-Class and 300-Class passenger locomotives are early &quot;as delivered&quot; and late as modified by Santa Fe shop variations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0fd460a641f4d3758c8b49562f0ce7499c30853","amp;dn":"RailWorks+-+ATSF+Warbonnet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0fd460a641f4d3758c8b49562f0ce7499c30853","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,253,70,10,100,31,77,55,88,200,180,149,98,240,206,116,153,195,8,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
