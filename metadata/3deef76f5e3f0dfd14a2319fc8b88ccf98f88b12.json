As the actors read their lines, director Rando Pettai intercuts staged scenes, with the leads playing their characters (some in drag). Something must have been lost in translation, because the wackiness is severely strained, and the farce, which for the most part consists of absurd plot developments precipitated by studio mishaps, falls flat. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3deef76f5e3f0dfd14a2319fc8b88ccf98f88b12","amp;dn":"Vanad+ja+kobedad+saavad+jalad+alla+%28eng+subs%29+%5B2003%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3deef76f5e3f0dfd14a2319fc8b88ccf98f88b12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,238,247,111,94,63,13,253,20,162,49,159,200,184,140,207,152,248,139,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
