Nestled in the Northern town of Goose Lake, Saskatchewan, Parry believes the contest the New York radio D.J. is running may be his ticket out of town, and away from a life to which he feels he never belonged. When Debbie Baxter, a young girl from California, arrives in the town by way of her father's position with the military, Parry soon discovers love, loss, and the magic of rock and roll.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54b3393c04206363ddd892ebdbb0c911592b2201","amp;dn":"45.RPM.2008.NorSub.DVDrip.XviD-ROYSKATT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54b3393c04206363ddd892ebdbb0c911592b2201","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,179,57,60,4,32,99,99,221,216,146,235,219,176,201,17,89,43,34,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
