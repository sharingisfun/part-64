The human \n                   appetite for this narcotic goes all the way back to 3000 B.C., when South Americans chewed coca leaves, \n                   thinking they were a gift from God. But it wasn't until 1855, when cocaine was first extracted from the coca \n                   leaf and used in powder form that its use spiked. Initially it was utilized as an anesthesia. Soon, famed \n                   psychologist Sigmund Freud touted it as an effective cure for depression and impotence. In 1886, John \n                   Pemberton, an Atlanta pharmacist, added it to his new soft drink: Coca Cola or Coke for short. In 1914, the \n                   drug was outlawed, but the damaged had been done. The 70's ushered in another boost in the drug's use, \n                   fueled in part by new drug cartels in South America. To combat cocaine's rise, the Reagan administration \n                   started the War on Drugs in the 80's.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7782b2bd067b482add536a7f3a42b04e41ba6fe","amp;dn":"History.Channel.Cocaine.History.Between.the.Lines.720p.HDTV.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7782b2bd067b482add536a7f3a42b04e41ba6fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,120,43,43,208,103,180,130,173,213,54,167,243,164,43,4,228,27,166,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
