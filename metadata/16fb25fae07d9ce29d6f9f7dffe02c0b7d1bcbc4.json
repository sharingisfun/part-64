It is packed with                 \n    passengers, among them a suicide bomber. The           \n        bus explodes, leaving Galia with severe                \n        burns and memory loss. She has no memory of            \n        the day of the terrorist attack and the days           \n    leading up to it. A necklace sent to her                  \n    from an unidentified source sets her off on                \n    a journey to find the missing pieces of the                \n    puzzle from that horrific day.                         \n                                                               \n                                                               \n                                                               \n                                                           \n                                                           \n                                                           \n                 \n                                                 \n                                                     \n                                                     \n                                                               \n    Reymond Amsalem as Galia                               \n    Eldad Fribas as Boaz                                   \n        Nadav Netz as Oren                                     \n        Ronit Yudkevitz as Dr. Talia                           \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                               \n                                                           \n                                                               \n                                                               \n                                                               \n                                                           \n                                                           \n                                                           \n                                                                   \n                                                                   \n                     \n                                            \n                                              \n                                                \n                                                           \n        We are currently doing high quality XviD, TV           \n        and DVD Rips.                                          \n        We are always looking for new talent,                  \n    newbie or pro we want you!                                \n                                                               \n    If u wanna learn to rip quality Xvid or DVD                \n    we can teach you.                                      \n                                                               \n        We are always interested in affiling good              \n        sites in europe or asia.                               \n                                                           \n    IF you think you can provide anything that             \n    could be of use for us (shells, bots, dumps,               \n    coding or anything else you can think of)                  \n       do contact us with an offer we cannot refuse              \n        :-)                                                    \n                                                               \n                                                            \n                                                           \n             \n                                             \n                                                 \n                                                  \n                                                           \n         To all quality minded groups in the scene.            \n               And to all our old members.                     \n                                                               \n             \n                                      \n                                              \n                                               \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n              You can contact us by messaging us.             \n              Where you say?
