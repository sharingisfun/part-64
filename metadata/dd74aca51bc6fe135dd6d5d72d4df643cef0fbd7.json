With the help of a full Camp Nou, BarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§a could be lifting the eleventh trophy of the Guardiola era.\n\nThree days after drawing 2-2 in the first leg at the BernabÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©u, the two sides go head to head again in another edition of the clÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡sico. It should be a thrilling evening in BarcelonaÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s first appearance at the Camp Nou of the new season. \n\nSlight advantage \n\n The draw from the first leg means everything is still to play for, but Villa and MessiÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s goals in Madrid mean that MourinhoÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s side are going to have to score at least once if they want to prevent BarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§a from winning the trophy for the third year in a row. But we all know that sitting back and defending a result simply isnÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t the Guardiola way. This looks like being a night of plenty of goals. \n\nMystery eleven \n\n BarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§a will not be announcing its line-up until an hour before the match. Xavi, PiquÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, Busquets and Pedro all started the first leg on the bench, but could well be starting tonight. And after an impressive debut, many will be wondering whether we will be getting to see more of Alexis SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡nchez tonight. \n\nBut the big question is Cesc FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â bregas, who trained for the first time with his new club on Monday and could make his debut tonight. If he does, we can be sure he will receive a rapturous welcome from the Camp Nou faithful. \n\nMadrid on a high \n\n MourinhoÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s side are confident that they can stop the Camp Nou party tonight. After finally arriving in Barcelona on Tuesday night, they have already shown on Sunday night that they are more than ready for the challenge, and all look in peak fitness, while some of the FCB players have only recently arrived back from their holiday. \n\nSuper cup number ten \n\n If BarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§a win tonight, they will collect the Supercup trophy for the tenth time, and the third in a row after defeating Athletic Bilbao and Sevilla in recent editions. But they know it wonÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t be easy, and in fact, they have lost all four Spanish Supercups when Madrid have provided the opposition. But if they can set that record straight, it would mean Guardiola has won an amazing 11 of the 14 official competitions in which he has led the team since becoming manager.\n\n\nThe Whites need to win or draw with three goals or more to take their ninth Spanish Super Cup title\n\nAlberto Navarro (Barcelona) / Translation by Michael J. O'Donnell\n\n\nThe winner of the Spanish Super Cup will come out of tonight's match at Camp Nou (23:00 CET). Real Madrid and Barcelona will clash again following the 2-2 draw in the first leg at the Bernabeu. The Whites need to win or draw with three goals or more in order to take the title. If the match ends in a 2-2 draw it will go into extra time. Real Madrid have a great chance to win, given the superiority and excellent form they showcased in Sunday's match.\n\n\n Jose Mourinho's team will look to be superior again. The entire squad is confident it can win at Camp Nou and has expressed its desire to win the title. Ganero has recovered in time for the match and is the new face on Mourinho's squad list alongside youth teamers Morata and Mejias. Sahin and Altintop will miss the encounter due to their specific recovery programmes.\n\n\nThe recently recovered Busquest and new signing Cesc Fabregas trained with the Barcelona squad again yesterday and may well be included in Guardiola's squad list.\n\nAlberto Navarro (Barcelona) / Translation by Michael J.
