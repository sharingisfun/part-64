Written by Chris Wallin, Aaron Barker, and Ira Dean, the\nsong was offered up by the songwriters to reflect the gratitude Adkins\nexperienced when his entire family was spared a fire that claimed his house.\nWith the exception of &quot;Just Fishin',&quot; produced by Michael Knox, the contemporary\nhonky tonk album was helmed by Kenny Beard and Mark Wright. There are ten new\nsongs on the standard edition, and 14 on the deluxe version, which contains a\nduet with ubiquitous pal Blake Shelton on &quot;If I Was a Woman&quot; and the anthemic\n&quot;Semper Fi.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e359e85ff719755ebeec35134fc1bb22d282a8c","amp;dn":"Trace+Adkins-Proud+To+Be+Here-2011-VOiCE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e359e85ff719755ebeec35134fc1bb22d282a8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,53,158,133,255,113,151,85,235,238,195,81,52,252,27,178,45,40,42,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
