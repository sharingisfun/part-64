To do this you need to use a ISO Editor and all files should be opened with a text editor like Notepad.\n* If you are installation this Windows XP on multiple Computers and want the installation process to run full automatically. Then use a ISO Editor program and replace the file &quot;WINNT.SIF&quot; in the &quot;OEM&quot; folder with the one that is in the &quot;I386&quot; folder. If you now Boot from the Disc then your main Hard disk drive will be formatted and a new partition will be create and Windows XP will be installed on this partition. Note that replacing the &quot;WINNT.SIF&quot; file will disable the Recovery Console and Repair Option that could be run from the Disc.\n* If the installation of Windows XP hangs or you get a Blue Screen error during your Windows XP installation then this is mostly because of a SATA driver problem. To fix this problem you should do the steps under &quot;Infos on how to Remove the included Drivers and include your own Drivers&quot; (If you have a Blue Screen error you can use a workaround for this by going into your BIOS and turn off the option SATA/ACHI or change the SATA mode to IDE. This should normally fix the Blue Screen error you get but with this workaround you will loss +/- 15% of your Hard disk speed).\n\n(o) Infos for Newbies:\n\n* Minimum System Requirements are: 600 MHz Processor, 256 MB RAM, 4 GB Hard disk drive, Super VGA (800x600) Video Adapter.\n* If you miss some standard Windows XP programs then open the Favorites folder of Windows XP and you will find alternative links to better programs. Some standard Windows XP programs are removed because they outdated for example the free Microsoft Outlook Express that has been replaced years ago with the free Windows Live Mail program by Microsoft.\n* If you want to change the Windows XP CD-Key after Windows XP is installed then use the Tool &quot;Keyfinder (Key Changer) v1.51.exe&quot; that is on the Burned Optical Disc and in the ISO file. You can also change the Windows XP Owner and Company with this Tool.\n* If you get a virus warning about the file &quot;Keyfinder (Key Changer) v1.51.exe&quot;, that's normal because almost all AntiVirus Programs are detecting Key Changers (Hack Tool) as a virus.\n* If you have a question or a problem then visit the Website &quot;www.zone54.com&quot;, but first make sure that you can't find the solution for your problem in 10 minutes over a Web Search Engine or over the forum search engine at &quot;http://www.msfn.org&quot;.\n\n\n[#] INTEGRATED APPLICATIONS AND MORE.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(o) Extras:\n\n* 7 new Windows XP Themes: (ChaNinja Style RC5 v1.0), (Luna Element Black v5.1 + CSS), (Windows 7 Colors v1.0), (Disney -

Download the Driver for the SATA Controller that is in your computer and then make a new folder and extract all files with a Zip Program like 7-Zip into the new folder (If there is no file &quot;txtsetup.oem&quot; in the Zip file you downloaded then use google to find the SATA Driver that has this file included because this can not work without it).\n2. Make a new folder on the Hard disk drive and called it &quot;WINXPCD&quot;.\n3. Open the ISO file &quot;Windows XP Professional 32-bit en-US - Black Edition v201X.XX.XX.iso&quot; with a Zip Program like 7-Zip and extract all the files into the folder &quot;WINXPCD&quot;.\n4. If you see a folder &quot;[BOOT]&quot; in the &quot;WINXPCD&quot; delete it.\n5. Now go to the directory &quot;WINXPCDOEM&quot; and run the file &quot;DriverPacks BASE - Remover vX.X.cmd&quot;.\n6. Download and install the program nLite from &quot;http://www.nliteos.com/download.html&quot;.\n7. Start the program and click Next and Browse to the folder &quot;WINXPCD&quot; abd after the loading is finish click two time on Next and then Select the option &quot;Drivers&quot; and &quot;Bootable ISO only&quot; and click Next.\n8. Now Click on &quot;Insert&quot; and choose &quot;Multiple driver folder&quot; and Browse to your folder where you SATA Drivers are and and click OK (If there is a 32-bit and 64-bit folder select the 32-bit folder).\n9. Select the appropriate driver for Windows XP 32-bit and then click OK and Choose &quot;Textmode driver&quot; and select all options in the Box &quot;Textmode integration options&quot; and click OK and then click Next and then click Yes and if the integration is done click Next.\n10. At the Option &quot;Label&quot; write &quot;WinXP_32-bit_BE&quot; or whatever you want (Maximum 16 characters) and then click &quot;Make ISO&quot; and Browse to the location where you want to save the new Windows XP ISO file.\n* To test if the ISO file with the new integrated SATA/AHCI driver will work on your Computer you need to install the program VirtualBox from &quot;http://www.virtualbox.org&quot; and it is also important that you set the Virtual Hard disk in VirtualBox to SATA or the test would be for nothing.\n* If you have a problem to include your SATA into your Windows XP then visite the MSFN forum at &quot;http://www.msfn.org/board/index.php&quot; and post the topic about the problem you have. But first make sure that you can't find the solution for your problem in 10 minutes over a Web Search Engine or over forum search engine before posting a new topic in the forum.\n\n(o) Infos on how to install Windows XP from an USB Flash drive:\n\n* First make sure that your Computer (motherboard) is also supporting USB Booting, if you can't find any option like this in your BIOS then your Computer (motherboard) isn't supported this so an installation of Windows XP from a USB Flash drive will not work.\n* Step by step on how to do this:\n1. Make a new folder on the Hard disk drive and called it &quot;WINXPCD&quot;.\n2. Open the ISO file &quot;Windows XP Professional 32-bit en-US - Black Edition v201X.XX.XX.iso&quot; with a Zip Program like 7-Zip and extract all the files into the folder &quot;WINXPCD&quot;.\n3. If you see a folder &quot;[BOOT]&quot; in the &quot;WINXPCD&quot; folder then delete it.\n4. Now download the Program WinToFlash at &quot;http://www.wintoflash.com/home/en/&quot; and install it.\n5. Start the WinToFlash Program and the Wizard will now help you to do the rest, but note that the &quot;Windows files path:&quot; is the &quot;WINXPCD&quot; folder and the &quot;USB drive:&quot; is the USB Flash drive that is connected to the Computer.\n6. If you done then restart your computer and press the key to enter the &quot;Boot Menu Option&quot; and select the USB device with the Windows XP on it. If the computer starts and there is no key to enter the &quot;Boot Menu Option&quot; then press the key for the for the &quot;BIOS Settings Menu&quot; and set the Boot Priority for the USB devices above the Hard disk drive and then select save and exit.\n* If you have a problem installting Windows XP from an USB Flash drive then visite the WinToFlash forum at &quot;http://wintoflash.com/forum/index.php&quot; and post a topic about your problem. But first make sure that you can't find the solution for your problem over the forum search engine before posting a new topic in the forum.\n\n(o) How to install Windows XP new:\n\n* Here are the steps on how to do this:\n1. BACKUP YOUR FILES FIRST and download all the Up-to-Date Drivers for your Computer from the &quot;Chip Card&quot; manufacturer Website.\n2. Select in your Burn program the option for Burning an Image file, and select the file &quot;Windows XP Professional 32-bit en-US - Black Edition v201X.XX.XX.iso&quot; and Burn the Disc at a low speed like 4x to avoid missing file errors if you install Windows XP. If you need a good Burn Program i recommend the free ImgBurn program at &quot;http://www.imgburn.com&quot;.\n3. Go to your Mainboard or Computer manufacturer Website and look if there's not a new BIOS update for your Mainboard (You can skip this but it is always better to have an bug free BIOS).\n4. Insert the burned Windows XP Disc in your Optical Disc Drive and then restart your Computer. If your Computer starts you should see a message &quot;Press any Key to boot from the CD.&quot; if you see this then you should press on your keyboard a random key. (If you don't see this message then you need go into your BIOS and set the Boot Priority for the Optical Disc drive above the Hard disk drive).\n6. Wait until Windows XP has loaded the drivers then press on your Keyboard the key &quot;ENTER&quot; and then the key &quot;F8&quot; and then the key &quot;ESC&quot;.\n7. Now select the Hard disk drive where you want to install Windows XP to it (Default is &quot;C:&quot;) and then press on your Keyboard the Key &quot;D&quot; and then the Key &quot;ENTER&quot; and then the Key &quot;L&quot;.\n8. Now select the same Hard disk drive again (Default is &quot;C:&quot;) and press on your Keyboard the Key &quot;ENTER&quot; and then you should select the option &quot;Format the partition using the NTFS file system (Quick)&quot; and press the key &quot;ENTER&quot;.\n9. Now you need only to install the Up-to-Date Drivers for your Computer and then you're DONE. :-)\n* If you get corrupted file error(s) or missing file error(s) during your Windows XP installation then try this here to fix it:\n1. Burn the Disc at the lowest possible speed.\n2. Use a new Disc and not an old scratched Disc.\n3. Clean the Optical disc drives.\n4. Use another or buy a new Optical disc drive.\n5. Try to install Windows XP from a USB Flash drive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86a0f930b0860e99ce2d0c974a7a6c55b8d89b94","amp;dn":"Windows+XP+Professional+32-bit+en-US+-+Black+Edition+v2011.8.14","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86a0f930b0860e99ce2d0c974a7a6c55b8d89b94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,160,249,48,176,134,14,153,206,45,12,151,74,122,108,85,184,216,155,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
