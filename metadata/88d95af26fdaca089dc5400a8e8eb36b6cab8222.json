After a couple years I lost my copy so I came back here to\nget it back but, sad to say, both versions had died out.  Zero\n100% seeds after several months of idling.  So, I went and found\nthe CD and started over.  I did everything the same as the\noriginal ripper except I used a slightly newer version of Foobar\n2000, I used GoldWave for the MP3 conversions, and I didn\\'t make\nnew scans (I\\'m using the original ripper\\'s jpegs here).  I\\'m\nalso posting the wave in case anyone wants to burn it as a\nregular audio CD, or perhaps do your own FLAC or MP3 processing.\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nOriginal ripper\\'s comments:\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nBox of Moon Light\n\nOriginal Motion Picture Soundtrack\n\nMovie link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115738/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115738/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCD Track list:\n01 - Mexican Radio - Wall of Voodoo\n02 - Red Right Hand - Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds\n03 - Blues Before Sunrise - Elmore James\n04 - Big Black Sky - Chaser\n05 - Too Much Tequila - The Champs\n06 - Carioca - The Fireballs\n07 - Wayward Nile - The Chantays\n08 - Lost Time Blues - The Chrome Cranks\n09 - Wheels Over Me - Die Haut\n10 - Gun Control - Tom DiCillo\n11 - Opening Titles - Jim Farmer\n12 - Tomato Field Fight - Jim Farmer\n13 - End Titles - Jim Farmer\n\nThis is my first CD rip ever but I happen to love this movie and\nthis soundtrack so I took great care to do everything by the\nbook.  I hope it sounds good to you folks with a critical ear.\n\nFirst of all let me point out a couple mistakes in the CD\npackaging.  One thing is that in the track list, both on the CD\nand on the tray liner, they listed the first ten tracks by\nArtist/Title and then the last three tracks by Title/Artist. \nStrange.  The other thing is that they misspelled the title of\nthe movie.  It\\'s \\&quot;Box of Moon Light\\&quot;, four words, not \\&quot;Box of\nMoonlight\\&quot; like it says on this CD.  The correct spelling can be\nseen at the IMDB page and more importantly, in the opening title\nscreen of the movie.  OK enough of all that, on to this\ntorrent...\n\nFirst of all I ripped the CD to my hard drive using Exact Audio\nCopy EAC v0.99 prebeta 5 according to the instructions on this\npage:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pchelpforum.com/cd-dvd-burning/51232-create-flac-image-audio-cd.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pchelpforum.com/cd-dvd-burning/51232-create-flac-image-audio-cd.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI think I got it right because it went precisely as the guide\nsaid it should, and EAC reported a 100% perfect rip.  The EAC\nlog is included in this torrent.\n\nNext I created two sets of files, one as FLAC for folks with\ncable, one as MP3 for those who need a smaller download.  I\nfollowed the instructions on that same page and created the FLAC\nfiles using Foobar2000 v0.9.6.8 which is the most recent version\nas of today, and then for the MP3 files I used a trusty old\nversion of AudioCatalyst and created them as 160/44 Stereo (not\nJoint Stereo) CBR.\n\nThen I scanned all of the artwork and the CD itself at 240 DPI. \nI included lossless versions along with the FLACs, and Jpegs\nalong with the MP3s.\n\nAnd that\\'s the whole story.  I hope you like it.\n\nThe Generic Scanner\nJune 17, 2009\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88d95af26fdaca089dc5400a8e8eb36b6cab8222","amp;dn":"Box+of+Moon+Light+OMPS+CD+-+FLAC+-+John+Turturro+-+Moonlight","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88d95af26fdaca089dc5400a8e8eb36b6cab8222","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,217,90,242,111,218,202,8,157,197,64,10,142,142,179,107,108,171,130,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
