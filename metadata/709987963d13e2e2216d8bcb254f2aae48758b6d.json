I tried to complete the document as good as possible (Info, labels and order) and fixed it where necessary. In short too much work to get lost on my PC only.\n\nSo, do not download this 4.5 GB for the music but for its historical value.\nAnd if you do, please help seeding.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:709987963d13e2e2216d8bcb254f2aae48758b6d","amp;dn":"Dutch+Retreat+-+Rock+History+OF+R%26R+%281952-1978%29++%28MP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"709987963d13e2e2216d8bcb254f2aae48758b6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,153,135,150,61,19,226,226,33,109,139,203,37,79,42,174,72,117,139,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
