Their first album \\'Wallpaper stories\\' from 2005 was warmly received and was appointed one of the top ten jazz albums of 2005 by the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. Their music is influenced by both singer/songwriter and modern improvised music. \n\nJosef Kallerdahl (bass) is known from bands like New Tango Orquestra, MusicMusicMusic and from Nils Berg 5 (\\'Jazz in Sweden\\' 2007). Erika Angell\\'s (formerly Alexandersson) voice have been heard in a lots of different contexts - she has, for instance, toured the world with indie act Loney, Dear, she is the voice in the duo The Moth (with drummer Martin Ohman) and is, of course, the prominent force in the critically acclaimed band Thus:Owls. \n\nTogether, Josef and Erika produces a very soft-spoken and beautiful music in the singer/songwriter tradition that draws closer to jazz and folk than pop or rock. Erika\\'s voice and Josef\\'s electric bass is in the centre of it all. The songs are performed in very fastidious arrangements that now and again are visited by something somewhat unexpected, like a saxophone (Nils Berg), a children\\'s choir or an Indian harmonium (played by Erika).
