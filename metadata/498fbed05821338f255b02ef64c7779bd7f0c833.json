Liverpool spent heavily during the summer, \nand their new signings will be eager to impress against Sunderland - \nparticularly Jordan Henderson, who could make his Reds debut against the club \nhe left just two months ago. Fellow midfielder Stewart Downing, \nwho joined from Aston Villa, could also play his first competitive game for \nKenny Dalglish's side. Arsenal take on Newcastle at St James' Park, \nscene of the Gunners' incredible collapse last season, when they surrendered a \nfour-goal lead to draw 4-4. QPR return to the top flight after a 15-year absence, \nwith Bolton providing the opposition at Loftus Road, while fellow newboys \nNorwich visit Wigan. Martin Jol's first Premier League match as Fulham boss is \nagainst an Aston Vila side also under new management, with Alex McLeish taking \nover at Villa Park this summer. Elsewhere, Blackburn host Wolves.\n\nTottenham v Everton was called off due to a load of dickheads in London.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:498fbed05821338f255b02ef64c7779bd7f0c833","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+-+13th+August+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"498fbed05821338f255b02ef64c7779bd7f0c833","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,143,190,208,88,33,51,143,37,91,2,239,100,199,119,155,215,240,200,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
