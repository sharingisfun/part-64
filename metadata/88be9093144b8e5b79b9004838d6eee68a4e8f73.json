His detailed analysis serves not only as a guide to reading the global warming skeptics, but also as a model for assessing the state of climate science. With attention to the complexities of climate-related phenomena across a range of areasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from Arctic sea ice to the Antarctic ice sheetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Lomborg Deception also offers readers an enlightening review of some of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most urgent climate concerns.\n\nFrielÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s book is the first to respond directly to LomborgÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s controversial research as published in The Skeptical Environmentalist (2001) and Cool It: The Skeptical EnvironmentalistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Guide to Global Warming (2007). His close reading of LomborgÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s textual claims and supporting footnotes reveals a lengthy list of findings that will rock climate skeptics and their allies in the government and news media, demonstrating that the published peer-reviewed climate science, as assessed mainly by the U.N.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has had it mostly rightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½even if somewhat conservatively rightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½all along. FrielÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s able defense of Al GoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s An Inconvenient Truth against LomborgÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s repeated attacks is by itself worth an attentive reading.
