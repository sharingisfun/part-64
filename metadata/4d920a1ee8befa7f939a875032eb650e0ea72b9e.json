Had some unexplained truncated files. I think it has something to do with a memory stick or something. I move the files around a lot during the month so I can work on going through files anytime... anywhere. Somewhere along that &quot;chain of custody&quot; is a real piece of crap hardware storage device that is messing up files, cutting off the ends, leaving some at like 200k when they were 6 mb originally. Stuff like that. I'll have to trace my steps and try to figure out where the weak link is. Excuses aside...\n\nAt least its a great month music-wise. Lots of summer vibe in here this time. There's an electronic bent this month, too. Unintentionally. \n\nI think what is impressing me most is how creative artists have been skewering pop conventions lately. Sure, there's lots of &quot;aping&quot; of 80s tropes and styles, and some of it is decent. But there are also some really &quot;out there&quot; tracks that still somehow manage to fall under the &quot;POP&quot; moniker. I like it.\n\nI hope your summer is going well. And I hope this music helps give your summer a\nsoundtrack.\n\nLove ya.\n\nSee you in August.\n\nAnd remember, you can read the NFO file with notepad or any plain text editor or reader.
