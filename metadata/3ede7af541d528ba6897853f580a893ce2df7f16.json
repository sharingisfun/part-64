It\nhas been put together to raise money for\nthe current recovery in Japan following\nMarchÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s earthquake.\n\nAs the sensationalist media broadcasters\nfind other things to talk about in the\nnews, a huge recovery operation is still\non-going as we speak. Many people have\nlost everything. So we decided to put\ntogether Kanshin so that via Ian\nHawgood, 100% of profit from compilation\nsales will go directly towards the Japan\nrecovery and on-going relief efforts.\nIan lives in Japan and his wife is\ncurrently working with both the Japan\nEarthquake Animal Rescue and Support\norganisation (JEARS) in Sendai and\nsurrounding areas, as well as the Direct\nHelp for Victims and Animals Rejected\nfrom Shelters in Japan group who are\ngoing up to areas which are not\nreceiving government support for food,\nwater, basic supplies, as well as\nrebuilding and cleaning up. By this\nmeans they are able to transport food,\nclothing and aid directly almost every\nother weekend and during holidays to\nareas which are not getting enough or\nany support. IanÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s wife has also\narranged a house as a base in Sendai for\nvolunteers and a temporary home for\nfound animals who are then moved on\nthrough JEARS either to foster homes or\nanimal centres. We felt that any funds\nwe can send this way would probably have\nmore of an immediate impact than\ndonating via one of the larger UK\ncharities.\n\nIan himself has contributed to the\ncompilation in a collaboration with\nPeter JÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â°rgensen and through 3 hours and\nsome 30 tracks, the line up that\ncomprises this album is surely as\nexciting as it getsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â \n\nKanshin is curated by Daniel Crossley\n(Fluid Radio/Fluid Audio/Facture) and\nJonathan Lees (Hibernate/Rural Colours),\nwith invaluable assistance from Ian\nHazeldine (Cover art), Wil Bolton\n(Mastering) and Damian Valles (Digital\ndistribution). This release is made\npossible by the generosity of all of the\nartists involved.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ede7af541d528ba6897853f580a893ce2df7f16","amp;dn":"VA-Kanshin-2CD-2011-BCC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ede7af541d528ba6897853f580a893ce2df7f16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,222,122,245,65,213,40,186,104,151,133,63,88,10,137,60,226,223,127,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
