It involves the adventures of three agents from outer space who are sent to Earth to determine whether the planet, a potential threat to the universe, should be destroyed. The instrument of destruction is a device resembling a large black ball with two antennae that is variously called an anti-proton bomb, a solar bomb, and a neutron bomb. Although the three agents (Captain Bokko, Nokko, and Pukko) are originally humanoid in appearance, upon arrival on Earth they take on the appearances of a rabbit (Bokko), a horse (Nokko), and a duck (Pukko) that they had captured as examples of Earth life forms. While on Earth they travel in a tire-shaped vehicle capable of enormous speeds called the Big Wheel, which can travel on both land and water (and, with modifications, through the air).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19391d00988eff21c9a6e19e053b1b37d6d692e4","amp;dn":"Wonder+3+disk+4+of+10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19391d00988eff21c9a6e19e053b1b37d6d692e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,57,29,0,152,142,255,33,201,166,225,158,5,59,27,55,214,214,146,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
