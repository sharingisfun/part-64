Set in modern day Los Angeles, Bad Day L.A. combines a fantastical art style, groundbreaking collaborative gameplay elements and a heavy dose of dark satire to create a truly unforgettable experience. In Bad Day L.A., players are thrust behind the shopping cart of a homeless man turned city-saving crusader, Anthony Williams, a reluctant hero who left behind the privileged life of a successful Hollywood agent after losing his self-respect. Anthony survives in his cocoon of destitution and isolation until Los Angeles comes under attack from zombies, terrorists, earthquakes and other untold disasters. Facing complete annihilation, Anthony is reluctantly forced to begin a cynical quest for salvation. Using only his street smarts and the environment to stay alive, he must save the very city and its citizens he despises, and, in the end, escape what has become a very Bad Day in L.A.
