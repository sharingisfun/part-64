At once gritty, whimsical and highly theatrical, the story moves from high schools and universities in Massachusetts, Princeton and Ohio to the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the Detroit riots, Vietnam and the dockyards of Liverpool. A combination of live action and animation, the film is paired with many songs by The Beatles that defined the time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:392efec8908f076da7670686aaab09a03409e0af","amp;dn":"Across+the+Universe+%5B2007%5D+DVDRIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"392efec8908f076da7670686aaab09a03409e0af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,46,254,200,144,143,7,109,167,103,6,134,170,171,9,160,52,9,224,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
