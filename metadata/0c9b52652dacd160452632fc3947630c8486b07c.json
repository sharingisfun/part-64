Perhaps even the best - although I have\nsome Bach Chopin and Beethoven pieces that are equally on the same list.\n\nI have always best liked the renditions by the Italian group I. Musici - \noften found on the Philips Label (Holland). This rendition features\nViolinist Pina Carmirelli while our other posting by I Musici has\nRoberto Michelucci doing the honours equally. The best in the business\nalong with Anne Sophie Mutter from Germany supremely too!\n\nenjoy this lovely music as most a favorite for a lifetime!\n\nPlease look for our 720p music video posting as well of this programming\nas it is already posted for you too - great sound (excellent 160k bitrate\non the video clip)!\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmusicfromrizzo\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c9b52652dacd160452632fc3947630c8486b07c","amp;dn":"The+Four+Seasons+%28Vivaldi%29+I.+Musici+%28192k+mp3%29+%28musicfromrizzo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c9b52652dacd160452632fc3947630c8486b07c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,155,82,101,45,172,209,96,69,38,50,252,57,71,99,12,132,134,176,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
