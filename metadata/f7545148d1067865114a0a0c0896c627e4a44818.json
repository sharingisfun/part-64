It is co-produced by Lenise Bent and mastered by Grammy Award winner Gavin Lurrsen (Johnny Cash, Allison Kraus and Robert Plant).\n\nA down-to-earth guy with lifelong wanderlust and more than a few stories to tell, Gary AllegrettoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s resume reads a bit like a Western adventure &quot;bucket list&quot; including stints as back-country forest ranger, forest firefighter on a &quot;Hotshot&quot; crew, LA city firefighter, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“bouncerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in a couple rough honky-tonks, cowboy and ranch hand, white-water rafting guideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and traveling musician. Through it all, Gary can barely remember a time when music wasn't a powerful part of his life, and playing harmonica wasn't as natural as his own voice. He started playing upon receiving his first harmonica at age 5 from his woodsman grandfather.\n\nAs his song goes, Gary &quot;knew the world was never gonna be the same&quot; and he was right. Since then Gary has travelled around the globe performing and giving workshops at many diverse festivals, venues and events. Hohner, the world's largest harmonica company endorses him. His music has been featured on film and television and is currently under consideration for two Grammy Awards.\n\nOf special note, Gary is the founder and director of Harmonikids, a 501(c)3 non-profit charitable organization that provides music therapy with harmonicas and lessons to special needs children internationally. Allegretto has provided aid to special needs children from the Tsunami refugee camps of North Sumatra, Indonesia to the Katrina evacuee trailer villages of Louisiana and many points in between. Harmonikids has received widespread acclaim in the media including The Today Show, Child magazine, Vogue, Blues Revue, and Living Blues Magazines.
