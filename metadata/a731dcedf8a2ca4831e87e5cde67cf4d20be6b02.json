One hour with news as you do not see it elsewhere.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSpecial reports\n\n- &quot;A Moment in the Sun&quot;: An Extended Interview with Independent Filmmaker, Author John Sayles\n\nToday, a Democracy Now! special with legendary independent filmmaker and author, John Sayles. Over the past three decades, he has directed 17 feature films, including Return of the Secaucus Seven, Matewan, Lone Star, and Eight Men Out. He has often used his films to tackle pressing political issues, as well as themes of race, class, labor and sexuality. His newest film, Amigo, which opens in August, is set in the Philippines during the U.S. occupation. Sayles is also a celebrated author. A winner of the O. Henry Award, he has just published his first novel in 20 years. It's called &quot;A Moment in the Sun,&quot; and it is a sprawling work which takes the turn of the 20th century in its sights - from a white racist coup in Wilmington, North Carolina, to the first stirrings of the motion picture industry, to the bloody dawn of U.S. interventionism in Cuba and the Philippines. We spend the hour with Sayles, discussing his work and career. &quot;However small your audience is, however frustrating it is to get your version of the world or what you want to talk about out there, it's part of the conversation. And if you shut up, the conversation is one-sided,&quot; says Sayles.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a731dcedf8a2ca4831e87e5cde67cf4d20be6b02","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+Special+-+04+jul+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a731dcedf8a2ca4831e87e5cde67cf4d20be6b02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,49,220,237,248,162,202,72,49,232,126,92,222,103,207,77,32,190,107,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
