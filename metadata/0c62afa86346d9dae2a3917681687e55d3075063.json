His friend introduces him to cinematographer Ganesh (Ganesh Janardhanan). With Ganesh's help Karthik becomes an assistant to director K. S. ravikumar. Karthik's family, who are Hindu Vellalars, rent Jessie's (Trisha Krishnan) house. Jessie is from a conservative Malayali Catholic Christian family from Alappuzha, Kerala, who live upstairs. When Karthik meets Jessie for the first time, he falls in love with her. Karthik expresses his love one day to Jessie, who is afraid of speaking to men around her strict father's sight, and ends up angering Jessie. The two meet several times and Jessie begins to admit that she also likes Karthik, but wants to refrain from any problems because she knows her father won't accept a Hindu to marry his daughter. But due to various misunderstandings between Jessie's brother and Karthik, her parents learn of their affair and arrange a marriage \nfor her. At the wedding, she refuses to marry the groom, displeasing everyone in her family. \n\nKarthik and Jessie continue to love each other without the knowledge of their parents.\nAt this point of time, Karthik goes to Goa on a 40-day shoot, where he gets rather busy. \nMeanwhile, the topic of Jessie's marriage comes up again at her home when the guy whom she refused to marry earlier pays them a visit. Panicking, Jessie calls Karthik and tells him that she wants to elope with him. Karthik, since he is traveling through less than ideal places, tells Jessie to stay in Chennai for now, and that soon he would be back and they can discuss. Jessie doesn't take his calls-so Karthik goes back one night to check on Jessie. Jessie has decided to break up, as the relationship is not peaceful due to her parents' disapproval. She doesn't want Karthik to wait for her too long, as he has his dreams to fulfill.Karthik later comes to know that she is married and settled abroad.Two years later, Karthik meets Nandhini (Samantha Ruth Prabhu), who falls in love with him, but is rejected by Karthik who cites his previous affair with Jessie over whom he has still not got over. He then comes up with a script for his first film, which happens to be his very own love story. He calls upon Naga Chaitanya as the film's protagonist, Nandhini as the female lead and Ganesh as the film's cinematographer, and the film is eventually titled Jessie. While shooting for the film in New York, he sees Jessie and she comes to speak with him. She admits that she is not married and is still in love with him, and he too says she is still in his heart. Karthik proposes yet again\nand they get married the same day. This is actually revealed to be a scene in Karthik's movie- which Karthik &amp; Jessie in real life are watching together in the theatre. In real life Jessie and Karthik have parted ways and are leading different lives.\n\n\n[URL=&quot;http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/402/vlcsnap2011080409h52m08.png/&quot;][IMG]http://img402.imageshack.us/img402/6900/vlcsnap2011080409h52m08.png[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=&quot;http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/98/vlcsnap2011080422h32m36.png/&quot;][IMG]http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/7903/vlcsnap2011080422h32m36.png[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=&quot;http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/24/vlcsnap2011080422h18m40.png/&quot;][IMG]http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/6180/vlcsnap2011080422h18m40.png[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=&quot;http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/5/vlcsnap2011080422h20m17.png/&quot;][IMG]http://img5.imageshack.us/img5/8669/vlcsnap2011080422h20m17.png[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=&quot;http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/847/vlcsnap2011080422h22m44.png/&quot;][IMG]http://img847.imageshack.us/img847/6358/vlcsnap2011080422h22m44.png[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=&quot;http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/52/vlcsnap2011080422h25m57.png/&quot;][IMG]http://img52.imageshack.us/img52/6241/vlcsnap2011080422h25m57.png[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=&quot;http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/195/vlcsnap2011080422h19m13.png/&quot;][IMG]http://img195.imageshack.us/img195/4456/vlcsnap2011080422h19m13.png[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=&quot;http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/20/vlcsnap2011080422h23m13.png/&quot;][IMG]http://img20.imageshack.us/img20/5674/vlcsnap2011080422h23m13.png[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=&quot;http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/231/vlcsnap2011080422h21m31.png/&quot;][IMG]http://img231.imageshack.us/img231/8562/vlcsnap2011080422h21m31.png[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=&quot;http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/62/vlcsnap2011080422h26m06.png/&quot;][IMG]http://img62.imageshack.us/img62/149/vlcsnap2011080422h26m06.png[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=&quot;http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/192/vlcsnap2011080422h38m41.png/&quot;][IMG]http://img192.imageshack.us/img192/7261/vlcsnap2011080422h38m41.png[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=&quot;http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/713/vlcsnap2011080422h28m18.png/&quot;][IMG]http://img713.imageshack.us/img713/8040/vlcsnap2011080422h28m18.png[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=&quot;http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/810/vlcsnap2011080422h27m45.png/&quot;][IMG]http://img810.imageshack.us/img810/5498/vlcsnap2011080422h27m45.png[/IMG][/URL]\n\nSample[/COLOR][/B][/URL]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c62afa86346d9dae2a3917681687e55d3075063","amp;dn":"Vinnaithaandi+Varuvaayaa%282010%29+-+BDRIP+-+720P+-+x264+-+AC3+-+%5BRA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c62afa86346d9dae2a3917681687e55d3075063","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,98,175,168,99,70,217,218,226,163,145,118,129,104,126,85,211,7,80,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
