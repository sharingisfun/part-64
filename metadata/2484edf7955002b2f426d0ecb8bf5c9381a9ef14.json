It's the easiest way to know what is going on with other applications while you are working on something else.\n\nOne day we were working with pictures in iPhoto while waiting on an important email to arrive. Every time an email came in, it interrupted our iPhoto work when we switched to Mail. We had no idea what each email was, we just had to keep clicking back over to Mail every time there was a new email. At the end of the day we decided that we needed a solution to this problem, and thus Growl was born (For Mail integration you will need GrowlMail).\n\nNever before has there been an anything that personalizes notifications in such an effective way. You can receive notifications in several ways, such as on screen, via email, or even have them spoken to you. Plus if you know a bit about web technologies (CSS/XHTML/Javascript) then you can make a Growl style look how you want it to.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Personalize your notifications. Choose Growl's presentation, look and\n  feels.\n\n* Keeps working even when you are not. Come back to your mac and\n  review what happened while you were gone with Rollup.\n\n* Easy to use Applications tab for controlling what you receive and what\n  gets blocked.\n\n* Speech display for hearing your notifications, great for those who are\n  visually impaired.\n\n* Awesome notification history, so you can see what has been going on.\n\n* A large variety of styles come with Growl. Anything from nano which\n  is tiny, to music video which is huge.\n\n* Make your own Growl styles very easily with web technology to give\n  Growl your own look and feel.\n\n* Send Growl notifications from Cocoa, Applescript, or over the\n  network.\n\n* Networking so that two or more macs can forward notifications to each\n  other.\n\n* Can work with the iPhone and iPad via Prowl.\n\nWhat's New:\n\n* Resolves issue with notifications becoming stuck and the close button\n  no longer functioning. Thanks for the feedback!\n\n* History now sorts newest to oldest by default.\n\n* Resolves an issue with the automator action being unusable.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac, OS X.7 and above\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2484edf7955002b2f426d0ecb8bf5c9381a9ef14","amp;dn":"Growl+v.+1.3.2+%5BK%5Dracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2484edf7955002b2f426d0ecb8bf5c9381a9ef14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,132,237,247,149,80,2,178,244,38,208,236,184,191,92,147,129,169,239,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
