Their all-too-common street-crime is interrupted by a more unusual event: an invader from outer-space crash-lands on a nearby car. \nThe immediate reaction of the gang is to kill the interloper, which looks like an unappetising cross between Sepp Blatter and the beast that burst out of John HurtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s chest in Alien. \nThey then parade its corpse triumphantly around their council estate, and celebrate by sampling the wares of the local drug-dealer (Nick Frost) who operates from the 19th floor of their tower block, and fancies himself a naturalist because he watches so much telly.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b55b30b66d0616e678175a6203554bbe40a27bdd","amp;dn":"attack.the.block.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b55b30b66d0616e678175a6203554bbe40a27bdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,91,48,182,109,6,22,230,120,23,90,98,3,85,75,190,64,162,123,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
