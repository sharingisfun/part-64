It is the fastest because it is the first Lucid to use the C and ffmpeg libraries optimized for i686 computers rather than the older i386 computers. Lucid 5.2.8 has also received a thorough going-over under the hood. There is new and updated firmware and drivers for many devices, courtesy of forum member tempestuous, and the hardware detection and configuration routines have been extensively tested and enhanced by forum member rerwin. The overall look and feel has been influenced by experiments forum member pemasu, to make the user interface fun for Linux newbies and experienced users alike. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bkhome.org/blog/?viewDetailed=02418&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bkhome.org/blog/?viewDetailed=02418&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://distro.ibiblio.org/puppylinux/puppy-5.2.8/release-Lucid-528.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://distro.ibiblio.org/puppylinux/puppy-5.2.8/release-Lucid-528.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nmd5sum : f04ec9ef3540be8e50d0a24c512e1309 lupu-528.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b922492b242f0150457c08af8b57c19f95f0abb4","amp;dn":"lupu-528.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b922492b242f0150457c08af8b57c19f95f0abb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,34,73,43,36,47,1,80,69,124,8,175,139,87,193,159,149,240,171,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
