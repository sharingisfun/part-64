Olive oil plays an important role in the reduction of blood cholesterol levels, hence reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke. It is a good source of antioxidants in the form of polyphenols and vitamin E and there is also emerging evidence that olive oil has a role in reducing the incidence of certain types of cancer.
