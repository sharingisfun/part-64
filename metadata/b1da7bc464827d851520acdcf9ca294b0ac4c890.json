The movies provide behind-the-scenes footage of the family at their Hyannis Port \n\t\t   and Palm Beach homes, and on trips to Europe and Asia. Featured are never-before-seen home movies filmed by \n\t\t   Robert and Ethel Kennedy in the early 1950s. This footage, shot by the Kennedys and their closest friends, \n\t\t   allows viewers to experience the forces and personalities that shaped their lives as never before.\n\n\t\t   Interviews with family members of Kennedy friends who took home movies provide fresh anecdotes and colorful \n\t\t   stories. Distinguished historians contribute new insights into this larger-than-life American family. \n\nRelease Notes....: Much of this show is not HD but there are numerous HD interview scenes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1da7bc464827d851520acdcf9ca294b0ac4c890","amp;dn":"History.Channel.The.Lost.Kennedy.Home.Movies.HDTV.XviD-DiVERGE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1da7bc464827d851520acdcf9ca294b0ac4c890","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,218,123,196,100,130,125,133,21,32,172,220,249,202,41,75,10,196,200,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
