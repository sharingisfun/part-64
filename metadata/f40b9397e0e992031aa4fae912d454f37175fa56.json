Gino Felino (Seagal) is a cop who grew up in a tough Brooklyn neighborhood, and while many of his old friends now live on the other side of the law, he retains a fierce loyalty to the community. When his partner, a friend since childhood, is murdered -- in broad daylight, and in clear view of his wife and children -- Gino is assigned to investigate, and he soon learns that the shooter was Richie Madano (William Forsythe), his life-long nemesis and now a low-level wise guy with an addiction to crack. Gino swings into action to bring Richie to justice, though he discovers that he's not the first in line -- the Don who oversees Richie's crew is appalled by this crime, and Gino has to bring Richie in before the Mafia can put a bullet in his head. Out for Justice also features Jerry Orbach, Jo Champa, and Gina Gershon; keep an eye peeled for John Leguizamo and Julianna Margulies in small roles. \n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 31 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\nFrame Width: 608 \n\nFrame Height: 352\n\nFrame Rate: 59fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 115kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f40b9397e0e992031aa4fae912d454f37175fa56","amp;dn":"Out+For+Justice%281991%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f40b9397e0e992031aa4fae912d454f37175fa56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,11,147,151,224,233,146,3,26,164,250,233,18,212,84,243,113,117,250,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
