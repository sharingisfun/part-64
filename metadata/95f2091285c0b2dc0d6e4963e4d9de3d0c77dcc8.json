This live concert recording should help fans to forget about the tabloid furor that surrounds Winehouse. The shows includes 17 tracks recorded live in London at the Shepherd's Bush Empire, and finds Winehouse in her element as she performs songs such as &quot;Rehab,&quot; &quot;You Know I'm No Good,&quot; and &quot;Valerie.&quot; Also included is a 50-minute long documentary on the singer which charts her sharp rise to fame.\n\nShepherd's Bush Empire\n01.
