ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a combination of his hill country inspired guitar and Cameron KimbroughÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s drumming. Together, they create a formidable blues duo. The album could benefit from a more varied choice of songs (there is a bit of repetition to the tracks), but in terms of laying down some classic performances, the album is a success. LightninÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ has a rough, tenacious tone and he weaves some spellbinding melodies. He is a master at letting the groove in a song find itself.\nOne highlight on the album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNorth MississippiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, displays LightninÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s truly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrenegadeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ spirit. He may embody the renegade spirit (with a rap verse section), but he also adheres to time tested blues tradition while sharing his reverence for the place that inspires his music. The very welcome addition of a horn section adds to the feel-good groove. The rest of the songs are equally imaginative in the way they enlargen the blues genre.\nRenegade is fused with elements of funk, reggae, soul, and rock, and consists of 13 tracks, of which 12 are all new original songs written and produced by LightninÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Malcolm. Renegade is mainly a duo collaboration with LightninÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Malcolm in addition to Vocals, also playing Guitar, Drums, and Bass, and Cameron Kimbrough playing Drums. The album also features Jim Spake (Baritone Sax), David McKnight (Tenor Sax), and Nahshon Benford (Trumpet). Other Special Guests include Nadirah Shakoor, J. Grubbz, Rosalind Wilcox, Dave Hererro, and Lucero (Horns).\n\n\nTracklist\n01 Ain't Even Worried\n02 Stop Fightin' Over Me.\n03 Renegade.\n04 So Many Women.\n05 Guilty Man.\n06 My Lyin' Ass.\n 07 Last Nite I Held An Angel\n08 Precious Jewel.\n09 Come Go With Me.\n10 North Mississippi.\n11 Foxfire Ranch.\n12 Tell You Girl.\n13 You Better Recognize\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:409d0437449a8ae23a31a87aced912ebae94054d","amp;dn":"Lightnin%5C%27+Malcolm++Renegade+%282011%29%28blues%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"409d0437449a8ae23a31a87aced912ebae94054d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,157,4,55,68,154,138,226,58,49,168,122,206,217,18,235,174,148,5,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
