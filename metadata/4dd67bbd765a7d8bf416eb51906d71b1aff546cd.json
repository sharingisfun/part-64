So when the normally cheerful Mr Toad despairs at the arrival of Mrs Ffleshe, a quite impossibly rude house guest, Mole sets out to help. But his plan to rescue Toad goes horribly wrong and, faced with the prospect of Christmas in the Village Gaol, Mole will have to act quickly if he is to keep the Christmas spirit alive. \n\n\nWhilst these books are not a continuation of Kenneth Graham's Wind in the Willows series, William Horwood is trying to explain what happened to Mr Toad at the end of the Wind in the Willows series.\n\nAnd in doing so has created a great yarn.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dd67bbd765a7d8bf416eb51906d71b1aff546cd","amp;dn":"The+Willow+at+Christmas+-+William+Horwood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dd67bbd765a7d8bf416eb51906d71b1aff546cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,214,123,189,118,90,125,139,244,22,235,81,144,109,113,177,175,245,70,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
