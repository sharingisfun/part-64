Based on a novella by the celebrated Madame de Lafayette, the action centers on the love of Marie de MeziÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨res for her dashing cousin Henri de Guise, thwarted when her father's political ambitions force her into marriage with the well-connected Philippe de Montpensier, who she has never met. When Philippe is called away to fight, she is left in the care of Count Chabannes, an aging nobleman with a disdain for warfare, and soon becomes exposed to the sexual and political intrigues of court.\n\nCast: MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lanie Thierry,Lambert Wilson,Gaspard Ulliel,RaphaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«l Personnaz\n\nDirector: Bertrand Tavernier\n\nVideo : 1280*544  5186 Kbps\nAudio : FR 5.1DTS 1510 Kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64fbfec81a8c953228c6299198b005a2673123b9","amp;dn":"La+Princesse+De+Montpensier+2010+BluRay+720p+x264-MAGiCAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64fbfec81a8c953228c6299198b005a2673123b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,251,254,200,26,140,149,50,40,198,41,145,152,176,5,162,103,49,35,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
