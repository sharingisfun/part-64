The series presents an intergalatic detective story, rich with mystery, unexpected twists and astonishing revelations.\n[edit] Seeing is Believing\n\nSophisticated computer graphics illustrate the evolution of the cosmos, and other leading cosmologists and scientists contribute their ideas.\n[edit] In the Beginning\n\nIn this programme, he examines theories of how the universe began, telling the story of a gripping scientific quest which reached a dramatic climax when scientists in America discovered cosmic background radiation.\n[edit] Cosmic Alchemy\n\nIn the aftermath of the big bang, how was all the matter around us - people, planets and life itself - created? Professor Hawking embarks on a remarkable voyage that leads from the dreams of ancient alchemists to the genius of Albert Einstein.\n[edit] Black Holes and Beyond\n\nMuch of Stephen Hawking's work has explored the mysterious possibilities of black holes. Yet for a scientist to believe in them meant abandoning the known laws of physics. Then astronomers started to see things in the sky far stranger than the wildest creations of science fiction.\n[edit] On the Dark Side\n\nIn this programme, he focuses on the search for invisible or `dark' matter, which is believed to make up as much as 80 per cent of the matter in the universe and which cosmologists are convinced holds the key to the fate of the universe. But how can they find the invisible?\n[edit] An Answer to Everything\n\nProfessor Hawking explains why he believes that scientists are close to discovering a single `theory of everything' that could describe the entire workings of the universe. \n\nTechnical Specs\n\n    * Video Codec: DivX\n    * Video Bitrate: averaging 1600+ kb/s\n    * Video Resolution: 640x480\n    * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1\n    * Audio Codec: MP3\n    * Audio BitRate: 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR\n    * Audio Channels: 2\n    * RunTime Per Episode: 00:54:30\n    * Number Of Parts: 6\n    * Part Size: 700 MB\n    * Ripped by I_M ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d238a7d98d97e56c835f7ada3c791978d3f478e0","amp;dn":"PBS+-+Stephen+Hawking%5C%27s+Universe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d238a7d98d97e56c835f7ada3c791978d3f478e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,56,167,217,141,151,229,108,131,95,122,218,60,121,25,120,211,244,120,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
