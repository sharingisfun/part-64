The first is the world in which the humans live, Assiah. The other is the world of demons, Gehenna. Ordinarily, travel between the two, and indeed any kind of contact between the two, is impossible.\n\nHowever the demons can pass over into this world by possessing anything that exist within it.\nSatan is the god of demons; but there's one thing that he doesn't have, and that's a substance in the human world that is powerful enough to contain him!!\n\nFor that purpose he created Rin, his son from a human woman, but will his son agree to his plans? Or will he become something else...? An exorcist?
