Despite floundering in his life - he was having troubles holding a steady job and his supposed girlfriend was about to marry someone else - he was not ready to leave the living. In heaven, he learns that despite it being a fantastical other world existence, he still has human emotions, such as romantic love, which he feels for a &quot;new&quot; soul he meets named Annie Packert (i.e. she has never been among the living on Earth), who in turn loves him. He also learns that one's next life is somewhat predetermined by their stay in heaven. So when Annie is sent to Earth for her first go around as a human, Mike pleads with the man in charge at heaven, Emmett Humbird, to locate him in his next human life at least in the same country so that he can find Annie..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdbfa57297e26b9c6739124af636bf9bfc84f653","amp;dn":"Made+in+Heaven+%281987%29+VHS+rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdbfa57297e26b9c6739124af636bf9bfc84f653","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,191,165,114,151,226,107,156,103,57,18,74,246,54,191,155,252,132,246,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
