ever\n        before to the world's greatest land predator.\n\n        Icebergcam, Blizzardcam and  Snowballcam are a  new generation\n        of covert devices on a  mission to explore the Arctic  islands\n        of  Svalbard in  Norway. Backed  up by  Snowcam and  Driftcam,\n        these   state-of-the-art   camouflaged   cameras   reveal  the\n        extraordinary curiosity and intelligence of the polar bear.\n\n        The  cameras are  just a  breath away  when two  sets of  cubs\n        emerge  from  winter  maternity dens.  They  also  capture the\n        moment when  the sea-ice  breaks away  from the  island in the\n        Spring.  As one  set of  mother and  cubs journey  across the\n        drifting ice in search of seals, the other is marooned on  the\n        island  with  very  little  food.  How  they  cope  with their\n        different fates is captured in revelatory close-up detail.\n\n        The cameras  also follow  the bears  as they  hunt seals, raid\n        bird  colonies,  dive  for kelp  and  indulge  in entertaining\n        courtship  rituals.  Icebergcam  even  discovers  their little\n        -known social nature  as seven bears  share a washed-up  whale\n        carcass.\n\n        Often just a paw's swipe from the play-fighting and squabbling\n        bears, the  spy cameras  face their  most challenging  subject\n        yet. When  their curious  subjects discover  the cameras, they\n        are subjected to some comical-but-destructive encounters.\n\n        As the  film captures  its intimate  portrait of  polar bears'\n        lives, it  reveals how  their intelligence  and curiosity help\n        them cope in a world of shrinking ice.\n\n     \n                                           \n                EPISODE SUMMARY                  \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n\n\n     \n                                           \n                   RIP NOTES                     \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                                    Enjoy!\n\n     \n                                           \n               GROUP INFORMATION                 \n        10 Years of the Force and still        \n                     going strong                      \n     \n\n        What we are looking for:\n\n        * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n        * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n        * Internal 100mbit 1tb+ dump sites for Exlusive group usage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61f51bc6ef18c48ee537455319d474d177ee7557","amp;dn":"Polar.Bear.Spy.On.The.Ice.Part.1.DVDRip.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61f51bc6ef18c48ee537455319d474d177ee7557","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,245,27,198,239,24,196,142,229,55,69,83,25,212,116,209,119,238,117,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
