It is based on Linux 2.6 kernel, Busybox, Tiny X, and Fltk. The core runs entirely in ram and boots very quickly. Also offered are Micro Core, a 6 MB image that is the console based engine of Tiny Core, and Multi Core, which includes Tiny Core, Micro Core, networking tools and an installer. Micro Core contains CLI versions of Tiny Core's programs allowing the same functionality of Tiny Core's extensions, only starting with a console based system.\nIt is not a complete desktop nor is all hardware completely supported. It represents only the core needed to boot into a very minimal X desktop typically with wired internet access.\nThe user has complete control over which applications and/or additional hardware to have supported, be it for a desktop, a netbook, an appliance, or server, selectable by the user by installing additional applications from online repositories, or easily compiling most anything you desire using tools provided.\n\nChange log:\n* Updated mnttool now allows user control of positioning the widget.\n* New autologin replaces rungetty.\n* Updated inittab to reflect change to autologin.\n* Updated multicore with the most current extensions e.g., ezremaster:\nForum announcement \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://distro.ibiblio.org/tinycorelinux/welcome.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://distro.ibiblio.org/tinycorelinux/welcome.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nmd5sum : bb9dcdf136e4181684ae42f7296b9c20  multicore_3.8.3.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:061e9f09aa2db9969a901481f7bda6126de73ec3","amp;dn":"multicore_3.8.3.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"061e9f09aa2db9969a901481f7bda6126de73ec3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,30,159,9,170,45,185,150,154,144,20,129,247,189,166,18,109,231,62,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
