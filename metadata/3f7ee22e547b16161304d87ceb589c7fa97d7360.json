Nazi hunters like Simon Wiesenthal sought Eichmann fruitlessly until 1956, when Eichmann's son bragged about his father's war exploits to his girlfriend's father, a half-Jew who had been blinded by the Gestapo and who alerted a Jewish attorney general of Hesse in Germany known for his prosecution of Nazis. Bascomb (The Perfect Mile) details Eichmann's wartime atrocities and postwar escapes, and how, in 1960, the Israelis decided to have secret service operatives (one of whom, Isser Harel, recounted these events in 1975's The House on Garibaldi Street)ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥mostly Holocaust survivorsÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥secretly kidnap Eichmann and fly him to Israel on El Al, disguised as an airline employee. Tried in Israel in 1961, Eichmann was executed in 1962. These were early days for Israel's now-legendary intelligence agencies, Mossad and Shin Bet, and it's fascinating how they accomplished their goal without the technical and monetary support that's now standard. Although Bascomb's prose is awkward, his work is well researched, including interviews with former Israeli operatives and El Al staff who participated in the capture, as well as Argentine fascists. This is a gripping read. \n\nCopyright ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€™Ã‚ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
