In the end I did not have space enough. So the lists have become very nice.\n\n\nBackground.\n\nThis download is meant for people (like me) who hate (or have no time) going through various Indie playlists every month. Running a bar I do this every month trying to find something nice (and new) for the customers. I usually end up with three lists.\n\n1. Nice, clear and easy for people who like to talk while listening.\n2. A bit louder for people who are not able to talk anymore (too crowded).\n3. The ones I like myself and do not fit in one of the above categories.\n\nOnly the best (sounding) tracks are selected. They are in 100% clean and fully labelled MP3 VBR format. This might save you some time.\n\nEnjoy and keep the Indie spirit high (by promoting, sharing and seeding).\n\n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2c8e35eac385271ca480dee3862f819400a1ce7","amp;dn":"Dutch+Treat+-+Indie+Playlist+0811+%28Indie+for+customers+MP3+VBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2c8e35eac385271ca480dee3862f819400a1ce7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,200,227,94,172,56,82,113,202,72,13,238,56,98,248,25,64,10,28,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
