Meanwhile, Amanda makes her entrance by a helicopter. But when the pilot falls asleep, Amanda has to jump out of the plane and lands on the set. Kenan Thompson and Josh Server (who have worked with Amanda from All That), deliver Amanda a pizza and wish her luck on her new show. Then, The Amanda Show starts its first sketch with Judge Trudy, who favors the children and gives out ridiculous sentences to adults. Then we meet The Klutzes, a family whose members always break things and say &quot;Not a problem&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the only episode i will be downloading of this show if you want more go to this link and download them yourself\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d763aa9a99ccdb57b2f224abe36f34a78778f507","amp;dn":"TheAmandaShowPilotEp.1.wmv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d763aa9a99ccdb57b2f224abe36f34a78778f507","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,99,170,154,153,204,219,87,178,242,36,171,227,111,52,167,135,120,245,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
