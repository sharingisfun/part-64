There are slight pauses in the original (which I never noticed when I listened to them) but after converting to mp3 they make a click sound.  I've tried to remedy this with different converters but all make that click sound.  I'll look for a better stream next week.\n\nAny ideas appreciated as I captured this stream as a backup to jwhitts and rarely listened to it let alone converted it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:befd88e540744bad0ffd46dd8c5b650a859a482a","amp;dn":"The+Rush+Limbaugh+Show+02-Sept-11+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"befd88e540744bad0ffd46dd8c5b650a859a482a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,253,136,229,64,116,75,173,15,253,70,221,140,91,101,10,133,154,72,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
