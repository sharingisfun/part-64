With the proliferation of video and photo technology in the modern era, reports of these events--along with visual evidence--have only increased. 95% of UFO sightings are false, resulting either from misidentification or deliberate hoaxes. But the other 5% cannot be dismissed. Based on the newly published book &quot;UFO's: Generals, Pilots and Government Officials Go On the Record,&quot; this two-hour special explores sightings that are supported by numerous creditable sources, from Air Force and commercial pilots, FAA officials, investigators, military Generals and NASA officials as well as hard data: photos, film, radar and audio recordings. This evidence presents a startling look at the very real possibility of alien visitation.    \n                                                                            \n\nRELEASE NOTES:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:040b2e565128a4b7b1881a7ece141e3d8a7c554d","amp;dn":"History.Channel.Secret.Access.UFOs.on.the.Record.720p.HDTV.x264-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"040b2e565128a4b7b1881a7ece141e3d8a7c554d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,11,46,86,81,40,164,183,177,136,26,126,206,20,30,61,138,124,85,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
