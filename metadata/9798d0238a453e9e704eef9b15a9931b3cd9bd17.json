This contemplative moodiness lingered in MilesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ music well beyond his impending hiatus and on to his death in 1991. The personnel shifts wildly from track to track; only Miles and Henderson appear consistently on all eight selections.\n\nHalf of disc 1 is taken up by a deep meditation on the legacy of Duke Ellington written not long after his passing. The piece is underscored by MilesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ funereal organ, with Dave LiebmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s alto flute adding a ghostly Ducal air. Next, a funk ballad floats on the foaminess of three guitars, Pete CoseyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pretty chordal vamps clashing with the dissonant organ. Track 3 was recorded in 1970 with MilesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ important lineup of Henderson, John McLaughlin, Billy Cobham, Keith Jarrett, Herbie Hancock, Airto Moreira and soprano saxophonist Steve Grossman. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRated XÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, recorded in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢72, sounds indeed like some twisted porn soundtrack with its horror-film organ and electric sitar.\n\nDisc 2 begins with another half-hour marathon that sounds like an acid trip on a beach in Trinidad. Dave LiebmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s liner notes say that track 2 wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t originally intended for Miles but he latched onto it after hearing it in the studio. It briefly sounds out of place with its large horn section and Wally ChambersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ hot harmonica, but soon enough the wah trumpet brings it all back home. Next comes a tribute to Mtume, the stellar percussionist who graces most of the tracks, loping along with underwater guitar sounds. The disc closes with MilesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ nod to soul icon Billy Preston. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGet Up With ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ offers a most interesting look at MilesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ artistic development across the first half of a controversial decade, a valuable document.\n\nMiles Davis - Get Up With It Tracks\nCD 1\n101  He Loved Him Madly 32:13    \n102  Maiysha 14:51    \n103  Honky Tonk 5:47    \n104  Rated X 6:51    \n\nDisc 2 \n201  Calypso Frelimo 32:06    \n202  Red China Blues5 4:07    \n203  Mtume 15:09    \n204  Billy Preston 12:36 \n\nPersonnel:\nCD 1\n&quot;He Loved Him Madly&quot; \nRecorded Columbia Studio E, New York City June 19 OR 20, 1974\nMiles Davis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric trumpet with Wah Wah, organ\nDave Liebman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Alto flute\nPete Cosey ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric guitar\nReggie Lucas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric guitar\nDominique Gaumont ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric guitar\nMichael Henderson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ bass guitar\nAl Foster ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ drums\nJames Mtume ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ percussion\n\n&quot;Maiysha&quot; \nRecorded Columbia Studio E, New York City October 7, 1974\nMiles Davis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric trumpet with Wah Wah, organ\nSonny Fortune ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ flute\nPete Cosey ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric guitar\nReggie Lucas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric guitar\nDominique Gaumont ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric guitar\nMichael Henderson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ bass guitar\nAl Foster ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ drums\nJames Mtume ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ percussion\n\n&quot;Honky Tonk&quot; \nRecorded Columbia Studio E, New York City May 19, 1970\nMiles Davis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ trumpet\nSteve Grossman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ soprano saxophone\nJohn McLaughlin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric guitar\nKeith Jarrett ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric piano\nHerbie Hancock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ clavinet\nMichael Henderson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ bass guitar\nBilly Cobham ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ drums\nAirto Moreira ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ percussion\n\n&quot;Rated X&quot; \nRecorded Columbia Studio E, New York City September 6, 1972\nMiles Davis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ organ\nCedric Lawson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric piano\nReggie Lucas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric guitar\nKhalil Balakrishna ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric sitar\nMichael Henderson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ bass guitar\nAl Foster ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ drums\nJames Mtume ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ percussion\nBadal Roy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ tabla\n\n\nCD 2\n&quot;Calypso Frelimo&quot;\nRecorded Columbia Studio E, New York City September 17, 1973\nMiles Davis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric trumpet with Wah Wah, electric piano, organ\nDave Liebman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ flute\nJohn Stubblefield ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ soprano saxophone\nPete Cosey ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric guitar\nReggie Lucas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric guitar\nMichael Henderson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ bass guitar\nAl Foster ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ drums\nJames Mtume ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ percussion\n\n&quot;Red China Blues&quot;\nRecorded Columbia Studio E, New York City March 9, 1972\nMiles Davis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Electric trumpet with Wah Wah\nLester Chambers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Harmonica\nCornell Dupree ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric guitar\nMichael Henderson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ bass guitar\nAl Foster ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ drums\nBernard Purdie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ drums\nJames Mtume ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ percussion\nWade Marcus ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ brass arrangement\nBilly Jackson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ rhythm arrangement\n\n&quot;Mtume&quot;\nRecorded Columbia Studio E, New York City October 7, 1974\nMiles Davis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric trumpet with Wah Wah, organ\nPete Cosey ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric guitar\nReggie Lucas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric guitar\nMichael Henderson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ bass guitar\nAl Foster ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ drums\nJames Mtume ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ percussion\nSonny Fortune ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ flute\n\n&quot;Billy Preston&quot;\nRecorded Columbia Studio E, New York City December 8, 1972\nMiles Davis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric trumpet with Wah Wah\nCarlos Garnett ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ soprano saxophone\nCedric Lawson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ fender rhodes electric piano\nReggie Lucas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric guitar\nKhalil Balakrishna ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric sitar\nMichael Henderson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ bass guitar\nAl Foster ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ drums\nJames Mtume ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ percussion\nBadal Roy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ tabla","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9798d0238a453e9e704eef9b15a9931b3cd9bd17","amp;dn":"Miles+Davis+-+Get+Up+With+It+%281970%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bflac%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9798d0238a453e9e704eef9b15a9931b3cd9bd17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,152,208,35,138,69,62,158,112,78,239,155,21,169,147,27,60,217,189,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
