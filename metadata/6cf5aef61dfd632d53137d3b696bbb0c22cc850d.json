The story revolves around a legendary Warrior Priest from the last Vampire War who now lives in obscurity among the other downtrodden human inhabitants in walled-in dystopian cities ruled by the Church. When his niece is abducted by a murderous pack of vampires, Priest breaks his sacred vows to venture out on a quest to find her before they turn her into one of them. He is joined on his crusade by his niece's boyfriend, a trigger-fingered young wasteland sheriff, and a former Warrior Priestess who possesses otherworldly fighting skills.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cf5aef61dfd632d53137d3b696bbb0c22cc850d","amp;dn":"Priest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cf5aef61dfd632d53137d3b696bbb0c22cc850d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,245,174,246,29,253,99,45,83,19,125,59,105,107,187,12,34,204,133,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
