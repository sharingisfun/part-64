But their attempts to clear the bridge are hampered by a stubborn lollipop man. Senior Constable Kate Fisher spots a driver she's pulled over many times, this time on the phone, and he attempts to continue driving on a suspended licence. Senior Constable Terry Moore is in a marked police car when a driver screams out of a side street in front of him. But the driving isn't the worst offence this man commits tonight as Terry discovers when he opens the boot of the man's car.
