Griffin frequently has Hargrove solo first and the trumpeter steps things up a notch above his usual fine playing in the jazz master's presence. An obvious favorite is Griffin's sassy blues &quot;The JAMFs are Coming,&quot; in which he leaves no doubt about how he feels about them, working in a hilarious quote from &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot;; Hargrove's rich flÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼gelhorn and Griffin's heartfelt tenor shine in the saxophonist's touching, bittersweet ballad &quot;When We Were One&quot;; while their chemistry is also extraordinary in Clifford Brown's exuberant bop vehicle &quot;The Blues Walk.&quot; James Pearson spells Newton on the rousing take of &quot;Lester Leaps In,&quot; with Hargrove and the pianist bracketing the leader's tightly knit solo. Paul Kuhn takes over the piano for Griffin's warm vocal rendition of &quot;How Deep Is the Ocean.&quot; The rousing finale is an extended workout of Griffin's &quot;Hot Sake,&quot; an easily recognizable reworking of &quot;What Is This Thing Called Love.&quot; It's sad that Johnny Griffin died only two months after these performances, but one hearing will tell you he played his heart out during his final record date.\n\n01.
