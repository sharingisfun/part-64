Being unsatisfied with the audio quality and sequencing of the release over at LucasArts Soundtracks and other sites, I took the enhanced CD version of the game and tried to make a listenable experience out of it. I also added the PC speaker version of the main titles to the album. The track list (below) and its song titles are different to other releases but I included alternative names of the pieces in the liner notes/comments of the FLAC files (and as tooltips on this page) to keep the confusion low. This &quot;19th Anniversary Edition&quot; tries to serve the audiophile as well as the completist. Download and have fun!
