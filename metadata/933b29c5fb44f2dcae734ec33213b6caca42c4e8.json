Gathered by fans of the show who have been collecting them for nearly a decade. All have combined their episodes together to list, here, in our forum. Now witness this dub, in its entirety, for the first time in years!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAlso included is the Bluewater dub of Dragonball and Dragonball GT!\n\nThe Bluewater and Ocean dubs were the ones that were aired in the UK and Canada between 1997-2005, these never made it onto DVD and were instead replaced by Funimations Dub. This dub was long thought to be &quot;Lost&quot; as Dragonball/Z/GT has stopped airing in the UK and Canada! But fans of the show have been gathering episodes on VHS for more than a decade and now that this project has been completed, we can finally share it with everybody!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI take no credit for the gathering of these episodes whatsoever, all i did was sort all the episodes in the correct order, put correct episode numbers and titles and put them all together in a torrent file for you guys.\n\nAll credit goes to the wonderful people over at http://www.forum.cartoon-world.org and http://www.forum.ukdb.net!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nQuality of the episodes vary from very low quality, to high quality, to complete re-masters, remember that 70% of these are VHS ripped.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDragonball:\nAll Episodes are High Quality TV Rips from when they were aired on Toonami in the UK. (Note: 4 episodes are missing from the collection, those being episodes 3,73,95 and 124, as they were not recorded by any of the guys, those 4 episodes are still being searched for, if they are ever found, they will be added to the downloads section of http://forum.ukdb.net)\n\nDragonball Z:\nAll Episodes Included, Quality varies, First 53 episodes are Dragon Box remasters of the Ocean Dub, Episodes 54-107 are from the Uncut Funimation dub as Ocean Group never dubbed those episodes, Episodes 108-276 are VHS rips from Toonami/Cartoon Network/CNX/Yor TV (Some episodes have dutch subtitles on them which cannot be turned off). Dragon Box remasters of episodes 108-179 + 225 are included in the &quot;Remasters&quot; folder.\n\n\n\nEpisodes #1-276\n\n(The entire Saiyan Conflict and Namek Saga have been remastered by oceandubman using the Spanish Dragon Box (still unofficial but closest to what we think it is) footage and all contain the recap and next episode preview.\n\n\nSaiyan Conflict:\n01.

The first and only complete version is the Dragon Box remaster, remastered by DBZImran of http://www.forum.ukdb.net, all of these episodes are Dragon Box quality, although most episodes are missing the recap and previews. Next you have the high quality TV-Rips, these are tv-rips of the Dragonball GT Blue Water Dub, recorded from Toonami, this includes the recap and preview and theme tune and end credits. (Only the first 40 episodes of this quality version are included, but if you want the rest you can get them from http://www.forum.ukdb.net). And last but not least are the Low Quality versions of this dub, this version is encoded in MP4 and is most probably best for use on portable devices such as iPhone or any other CellPhone. (Only episodes 25-64 of this quality are available. Unfortunately, you cannot get the rest of these anymore).\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWell that's it from me, You can now all enjoy this amazing dub of Dragonball/Z/GT, a dub which up until now has been labeled either &quot;Dead&quot; or &quot;Extremely Rare&quot;!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:933b29c5fb44f2dcae734ec33213b6caca42c4e8","amp;dn":"Dragonball+Bluewater+Dub+%2B+Dragonball+Z+Ocean+Dub+%2B+Dragonball+G","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"933b29c5fb44f2dcae734ec33213b6caca42c4e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,59,41,197,251,68,242,220,174,115,78,195,50,19,182,202,202,66,196,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
