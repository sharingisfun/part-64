What have you been up to since our last visit? Don't answer\nthat. We already know.\n\nLewd jokes? Check. Racist chain mails? Check. You lost your radio license? Lulz.\nPlaying on the fears of voters? Check. But we already figured that. Our friends,\nallies, and vessels are threatened with 10+ years in prison. Yet terrorists like\nLuis Posada Carilles go free. This hypocritical and paranoid reaction puts us\nand the citizens you are supposed to protect in the same boat. You call us a\nnational security risk. Yet BATFE guns go directly to drug dealers so they can\ntake out rivals who don't launder money through backrooms of dominant banks. Any\npress can check court documents from operations like 'Fast and Furious'. Who\ncame up with that one? What you didn't see 'From Dusk 'til Dawn'? Better title.\nBe more creative next time.\n\nIn retaliation for the arrests of dozens of alleged Anonymous suspects, we\nopened fire on dozens of Texas police departments and stole boatloads of\nclassified police documents and police chief emails across the state. During the\nSan Jose courtdate we defaced and gave out live backdoor and admin access to the\nwebsite TexasPoliceChiefs.org while allied ships launched ddos attacks upon\nJustice.gov and other law enforcement websites. For every defendant in the\nanonymous &quot;conspiracy&quot; we are attacking two top Texas police chiefs, leaking 3GB\nof their private emails and attachments. Mind you, we don't expect a sane\nresponse. Even a few insults would have been better than the way you cowards\nhide behind protocol, innuendo, and your badge. \n\nFor more than a month we have been lurking their emails, law enforcement\nportals, and records and reporting systems. We leaked a few teasers including\naccess to fbivirtualacademy.edu, several classified documents, voicemail\nrecordings, live passwords, and even some dirty pictures. To continue the \nfighting spirit of WikiLeaks, we want to share the full Texas collection and\nexpose these bumbling fools and all their secrets to the world.\n\nThousands of documents are available on tor hidden services / bittorrent and\ninclude several dozen FBI, Border Patrol, and counter-terrorism documents\nclassified as &quot;law enforcement sensitive&quot; and &quot;for official use only&quot;. The\nemails also included police records, internal affairs investigations, meeting\nnotes, training materials, officer rosters, security audits, and live password\ninformation to government systems. The private chief emails also included\nseveral racist and sexist chain email forwards and personal details sure to\nembarrass, discredit, and incriminate several of these so-called &quot;community\nleaders&quot;.\n\nWe are attacking Texas law enforcement as part of &quot;Chinga La Migra&quot; as they\ncontinue to harass immigrants and use border patrol operations as a cover for\ntheir backwards racist prejudice. The notoriously racist police state of Texas\nrecently passed SB 9 and &quot;Secure Comminities&quot; anti-immigration laws. Texas is\nwell known and hated for being full of Minutemen, Tea Party and KKK groups,\nmurdering the most amount of innocent people on death row, and giving us the\nBush and Cheney administration. Two months ago on the 1st we attacked the\nArizona DPS and defaced several Fraternal Order of Police websites. One month\nago we &quot;Shot The Sheriff&quot; and released 10GB of private law enforcement data\nwhile defacing dozens of police department websites in several states in the\nsouth. A week ago we released private emails belonging to Richard T. Garcia, VP\nof Texas-based Vanguard Defense Industries, and also a former FBI agent and\ncurrent Infragard executive board member.\n\nWe are doing this in solidarity with the &quot;Anonymous 16&quot; PayPal LOIC defendants,\naccused LulzSec member Jake Davis &quot;Topiary&quot;, protesters arrested during #OpBart\nactions, Bradley Manning, Stephen Watt, and other hackers and leakers worldwide.\nWe also call for the release of Leonard Peltier, Mumia Abu Jamal, Oscar Lopez\nRivera, Troy Davis, the Angola 3, and all others behind bars standing up to\nstate repression. While many of our comrades facing charges and in prison are\ninnocent, there is no such thing as an innocent police officer, and we will\ncontinue to directly attack the prison industrial complex by leaking their\nprivate data, destroying their systems, and defacing their websites.\n\nWe might have respect for these officers if they understood their job and whom\nthey serve. But unlike some that left the force decades ago and rumors abound\nthat they may have joined our ranks, these officers hide behind their badge and\nuse policies to ignore their great responsibility. These officers betrayed the\ntrust citizens have in them by choosing be drones of the system rather than\nprotectors of freedom and the peace of their communities. From the lowest prison\nguard to the mightiest chief, we will continue to attack the cogs of the\npolice state that protects the interests of the rich and powerful.\n\nHackers all over the world are uniting to make 2011 the year of hacks and\nrevolutions. Join us, comrades: open fire on governments, law enforcement\norganizations, white hat, corporate and military targets!\n\n################################################################################\n\n  [*[ THE DEFACEMENT!!\n      Mirrored at http://zone-h.org/mirror/id/14841451\n\n  [*] THE FILES!!\n     &lt;a href=&quot; http://vv7pabmmyr2vnflf.onion/tx/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://vv7pabmmyr2vnflf.onion/tx/&lt;/a&gt;               &lt;- on tor\n     &lt;a href=&quot; http://vv7pabmmyr2vnflf.tor2web.org/tx/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://vv7pabmmyr2vnflf.tor2web.org/tx/&lt;/a&gt;         &lt;- not on tor\n      \n  [*] THE TORRENT!!\n     &lt;a href=&quot; http://wikisend.com/download/269976/texsastakedownthursday.torrent&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://wikisend.com/download/269976/texsastakedownthursday.torrent&lt;/a&gt;\n      \n  [*] DONATE BITCOINS!!\n      18NHixaoQekQJ3y52aBGJJwgBWX9X3myYR\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8888fc88ef3fb6689ada0911b2f65358ac35c5b4","amp;dn":"Texas+Takedown+Thursday%3A+Chinga+La+Migra+IV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8888fc88ef3fb6689ada0911b2f65358ac35c5b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,136,252,136,239,63,182,104,154,218,9,17,178,246,83,88,172,53,197,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
