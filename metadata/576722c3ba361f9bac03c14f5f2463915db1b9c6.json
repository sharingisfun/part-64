MEPIS Linux is derived from the stable and testing branches of Debian Linux.\nExcept for Diet Swift Linux, all editions of Swift Linux now include OpenOffice and forensic/rescue/recovery programs. Forensic Swift Linux has been discontinued, but its capabilities live on in regular Swift Linux and the special editions.\n...\nSwift Linux provides the benefits of Ubuntu in a much lighter package. The result is a distro that works on even older computers, yet still has the user-friendliness and superior software selection of Ubuntu.\n... &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.swiftlinux.org/about&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.swiftlinux.org/about&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSPECIAL NOTES!!!\n\n Certain computers may only boot up Swift Linux and antiX Linux on CD-Rs. If your computer does not boot up Swift Linux on a CD-RW, try Swift Linux on a CD-R.\n CRT users: Make sure your monitor is on when you boot up Swift Linux or antiX Linux. Do NOT turn off the monitor. If you are using a KVM switch, make sure your monitor is set for the computer booting up to Swift Linux, and do NOT switch to the other computer. If you try to boot up Swift Linux (or antiX Linux) without the monitor, things won't work properly. If you ignore this warning and find that you can't boot up properly, press Ctrl-Alt-Backspace to log in and enter the command &quot;startx&quot; at the prompt.\n\nUsername/Password\n\n When you boot up with the live CD, you may be asked to enter your username and password. Enter demo for both.\n When you run Swift Linux with the live CD, you will be asked for the root/administrative password. Enter root.\n If you install Swift Linux, you will be asked to provide a username, a password for that username, and a root/administrative password.\n\nLocation\nThe ISO files are hosted on SourceForge, where you can also find their md5sum values and sizes.\nCurrent Version: 0.1.2 (based on antiX M11)\nPlain vanilla editions\nDiet Swift Linux\nRegular Swift Linux\n\nSpecial editions\nTaylor Swift Linux\nMinnesota Swift Linux\nChicago Swift Linux  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.swiftlinux.org/downloads&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.swiftlinux.org/downloads&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.swiftlinux.org/screenshots&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.swiftlinux.org/screenshots&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.swiftlinux.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.swiftlinux.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://swiftlinux.org/discuss&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://swiftlinux.org/discuss&lt;/a&gt;\n\nsha1sum : 52d36eca56d43f4199a43d4d7509b0311048df37  swiftlinux-0_1_2-diet.iso\nmd5sum : e83a8618b540690a3127837d20754867  swiftlinux-0_1_2-diet.iso\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:576722c3ba361f9bac03c14f5f2463915db1b9c6","amp;dn":"swiftlinux-0_1_2-diet.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"576722c3ba361f9bac03c14f5f2463915db1b9c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,103,34,195,186,54,31,155,172,3,193,79,95,36,99,145,93,177,185,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
