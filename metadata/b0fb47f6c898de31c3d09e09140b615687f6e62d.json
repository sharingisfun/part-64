Using rigorous methods and data drawn from around the globe, M. Steven Fish reveals that in some areas Muslims and non-Muslims differ less than is commonly imagined. Muslims are not inclined to favor the fusion of religious and political authority or especially prone to mass political violence. Yet there are differences: Gender inequality is more severe among Muslims, Muslims are unusually averse to homosexuality and other controversial behaviors, and democracy is rare in the Muslim world. Other areas of divergence bear the marks of a Muslim advantage: Homicide rates and class-based inequities are less severe among Muslims than non-Muslims. Fish's findings have vital implications for human welfare, interfaith understanding, and international relations.\n\nOxford 2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0fb47f6c898de31c3d09e09140b615687f6e62d","amp;dn":"Are+Muslims+Distinctive%3F%3A+A+Look+at+the+Evidence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0fb47f6c898de31c3d09e09140b615687f6e62d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,251,71,246,200,152,222,49,195,208,158,9,20,11,97,86,135,246,230,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
