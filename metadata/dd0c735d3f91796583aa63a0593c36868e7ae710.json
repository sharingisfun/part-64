In January 2010, however, Funimation Entertainment announced that they would be re-releasing the series on DVD and releasing for the first time on Blu-ray.[1] In addition, the series aired on TV in America on Cartoon Network\\'s Adult Swim several times. The series is also avaliable via Netflix, Hulu, iTunes, and on Funimation Entertainment\\'s website.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd0c735d3f91796583aa63a0593c36868e7ae710","amp;dn":"%5BCoalgirls%5D+FLCL+%28Dual+Audio+-+960x720%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd0c735d3f91796583aa63a0593c36868e7ae710","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,12,115,93,63,145,121,101,131,170,99,160,89,60,54,134,142,122,231,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
