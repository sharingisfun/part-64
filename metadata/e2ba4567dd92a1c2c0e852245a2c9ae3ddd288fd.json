Like Ariel Pink, minus the tape hiss, Kelleher crafts songs to be sung outside closed windows, or from behind drawn curtains. Perry Como meets Passion Pit on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Until I Get PaidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, as sleepy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdoo-wopsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and grainy instrumentation sidle underneath KelleherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s slinky tones. Elsewhere, 8-bit blitzkriegs are blasted in homage to Miami Vice (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“He Has To Sleep SometimeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢) and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Coat To WearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is the track Owen Pallett wishes heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d written. Though the record swoops from texture to texture, it all remains united under a slight cloud of reverb. Ever tried. Ever failed? Oh no. Ever tried. Ever succeeded.
