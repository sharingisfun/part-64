Steeds finds that the movement, far from stemming the tide of extinction that's\nengulfing the planet, has got many of its conservation priorities wrong.\n\nShould large conservation organizations be involved in eviction, rape and murder to create living space for animals while displacing native people?\n\nShould major conservation projects be re-introducing ugly colonialist attitudes and alienating local populations who can much better help to conserve wildlife?\n\nDo the major conservation groups pander to the publicity needs of corporate greed to self-promote themselves?\nAre the major conservation 'brands' cultivating cute, cuddly and colorful projects while ignoring the urgent needs of more strategic, endangered species?\n\nThe film examines the way the big conservation charities are run. It questions why some work with\npolluting big businesses to raise money and are alienating the very people they would need to stem the loss of species from earth.\n\nConservation is massively important but few dare to question the movement. Some critics argue that it is in part getting it wrong, and that, as a consequence crucial natural resources are heading to oblivion.\n\n\nFile Name.........: Dispatches - Conservation's Dirty Secrets.WnA.avi\n\n\nSource: http://www.uknova.com/wsgi/torrent/view/116141\nCap: WnA ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91ad1dae7bdfe7a856d823d2aa64030d018e72a4","amp;dn":"Dispatches+-+Conservation%5C%27s+Dirty+Secrets+2011+06+20+Ch+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91ad1dae7bdfe7a856d823d2aa64030d018e72a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,173,29,174,123,223,231,168,86,216,35,210,170,100,3,13,1,142,114,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
