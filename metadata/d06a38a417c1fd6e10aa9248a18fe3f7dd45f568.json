The song, co-written by James and Alonzo Miller, was first released on James' album &quot;Street Songs&quot; and became one of James' signature songs. It features background vocals from Motown labelmates The Temptations, in which the bass singer is James' uncle Melvin Franklin, and Canadian singer Taborah Johnson. &quot;Freak&quot; is a slang term for, as described in the song's lyrics, &quot;...a very kinky girl / The kind you don't take home to mother&quot;.\n    Rolling Stone magazine ranked the song #477 in its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.The song was a big hit for James in 1981, charting on the pop, R&amp;B and dance charts in the U.S. On the Billboard Hot 100 chart, the song peaked at #16 in the fall of 1981 and spent 10 weeks in the top 40. Together with two other singles from Street Songs, &quot;Give It to Me Baby&quot; and &quot;Ghetto Life&quot;, it spent three weeks at #1 on the American dance charts earlier that year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    TOTAL LIST  (31.07.2011)\n          \n                HISTORY OF POP AND ROCK MUSIC \n\n\n\n08.10.01  DISCO MUSIC ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ FUNK ORIENTED BACKGROUNDS \n\n       Funk music was a major influence on the development of disco music. Funk musicians blended soul music, soul jazz and R&amp;B into a rhythmic, danceable new form of music. Disco funk\ntypically consists of a complex groove with rhythm instruments such as electric guitar, electric bass, Hammond organ, and drums playing interlocking rhythms. Funk bands sometimes have a horn section of several saxophones, trumpets, and in some cases, a trombone, which plays rhythmic &quot;hits&quot;.\n\n\n         THE COMMODORES  -   BRICK HOUSE  (1977)\n         BROTHERS JONHSON  -  STRAWBERRY LETTER  23  (1977)\n         A TASTE OF HONEY -  BOOGIE OOGIE   (1978)\n         CHIC - LE FREAK  (1978)\n         EARTH,WIND &amp; FIRE  -  FANTASY  (1978)\n         THE BROTHERS JOHNSON  -  STOMP  (1979)\n         KOOL AND THE GANG  -  LADIES NIGHT   (1979)\n         THE JACKSONS  -  BLAME IT ON THE BOOGIE  (1979)\n         MICHAEL JACKSON  -  DON'T STOP 'TIL YOU GET ENOUGH (1979)\n         THE REAL THING   -  CAN YOU FEEL THE FORCE  (1979)\n         THE SUGARHILL GANG  - RAPPERÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S DELIGHT   (1979)\n         THE GAP BAND ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ BURN RUBBER ON ME (Why You Wanna Hurt Me)  (1980)\n         KOOL &amp; THE GANG - CELEBRATION   (1980)    \n         ODISSEY - USE IT UP AND WEAR IT OUT   (1980)\n         ODISSEY -  GOING BACK TO MY ROOTS  (1981)                       \n         KOOL &amp; THE GANG ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Get Down On It   (1981)\n         RICK JAMES  - Superfreak  (1981)\n         YARBROUGH &amp; PEOPLES  -  DONÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢T STOP THE MUSIC  (1981)   \n         GIBSON BROTHERS ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ QUE SERA MI VIDA  (1981)\n         EARTH,WIND &amp; FIRE  -  FALL IN LOVE WITH ME   (1982)\n         EARTH,WIND &amp; FIRE  - LET'S GROOVE  (1982)\n         OSIBISA  - SUNSHINE DAY   (1983)\n         BILLY OCEAN  - WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH, THE TOUGH GET GOING (1985)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d06a38a417c1fd6e10aa9248a18fe3f7dd45f568","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+310","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d06a38a417c1fd6e10aa9248a18fe3f7dd45f568","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,106,56,164,23,193,253,110,16,170,146,72,161,143,227,247,221,69,245,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
