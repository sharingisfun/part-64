I want to trust them. But can I? This week, we try to answer that question with the help of our guests.\n\nPolitical pollster and word analyst Frank Luntz says politicians consistently mislead us, but rarely get caught due to the careful choice of phrases.\n\nIn his State of the Union speech, President Obama said that he and Congress had agreed to cut the deficit by $2 trillion. Terrific! But Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow from the Cato Institute, will explain why the cut isn't real.\n\nFormer CBS reporter Bernie Goldberg tells us about his experience as the CBS &quot;Bias&quot; whistle blower.\n\nAdam Bellow argues that nepotism is useful.\n\nBjorn Lomborg is reasonable about climate change, but I don't trust his recommendation.\n\nA Gallup poll found that 6% of Americans believe the Apollo moon landing was staged. More believe that President Bush staged the 9-11 attacks to provide an excuse for invading Iraq. Skeptic Magazine's Michael Shermer dispels some of the myths.\n\nJoin us this week to find out whom you can trust.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9f43ea7e63148caaa99d748d93f1bc51f5f25d5","amp;dn":"20120209-Stossel-%5BWho+Can+You+Trust%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9f43ea7e63148caaa99d748d93f1bc51f5f25d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,244,62,167,230,49,72,202,170,153,215,72,217,63,27,197,31,95,37,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
