Sanders\n \nMartin Stillwater has a vivid imagination. It charms his loving wife, delights his two little daughters, and gives him all the inspiration he needs to write his highly successful mystery novels. But maybe MartinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s imagination is a bit too vivid.\nOne rainy afternoon, a terrifying incident makes him question his grip on reality. A stranger breaks into his house, accusing Martin of stealing his wife, his childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and his life. Claiming to be the real Martin Stillwater, the intruder threatens to take what is rightfully his. The police think heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a figment of MartinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s imagination. But Martin and his family have no choice but to believe the strangerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s threat. And run for their lives. But wherever they goÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½wherever they hideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½he finds them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10fb474662bc4f6332b5461702902734792b9124","amp;dn":"Mr.+Murder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10fb474662bc4f6332b5461702902734792b9124","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,251,71,70,98,188,79,99,50,181,70,23,2,144,39,52,121,43,145,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
