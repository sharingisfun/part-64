In fact, new research from neuroscientists and psychologists suggests that the brain reorganizes, improves in important functions, and even helps us adopt a more optimistic outlook in middle age. We recognize patterns faster, make better judgments, and find unique solutions to problems. Part scientific survey, part how-to guide, The Secret Life of the Grown- up Brain is a fascinating glimpse at our surprisingly talented middle-aged minds.\n\n256 pages \nPublisher: Penguin (Non-Classics) (February 22, 2011) \nLanguage: English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:960f89903b6828732b00c7cddd14df2622b925d3","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Life+of+the+Grown-up+Brain+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"960f89903b6828732b00c7cddd14df2622b925d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,15,137,144,59,104,40,115,43,0,199,205,221,20,223,38,34,185,37,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
