It is based on Linux 2.6 kernel, Busybox, Tiny X, and Fltk. The core runs entirely in ram and boots very quickly. Also offered are Micro Core, a 6 MB image that is the console based engine of Tiny Core, and Multi Core, which includes Tiny Core, Micro Core, networking tools and an installer. Micro Core contains CLI versions of Tiny Core's programs allowing the same functionality of Tiny Core's extensions, only starting with a console based system.\nIt is not a complete desktop nor is all hardware completely supported. It represents only the core needed to boot into a very minimal X desktop typically with wired internet access.\nThe user has complete control over which applications and/or additional hardware to have supported, be it for a desktop, a netbook, an appliance, or server, selectable by the user by installing additional applications from online repositories, or easily compiling most anything you desire using tools provided.\n\nThe latest version: 3.8.1\n\n...\nUpdated Freedesktop .desktop items for appsaudit, run, and editor icons.\nUpdated tce-setup to handle both cdroms and isohybrid images, as well as other ISO9660 hosted images.\nUpdated ondemand for extension name matching for onboot and ondemand select lists as used by AppsAudit\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.tinycorelinux.net/index.php?PHPSESSID=o9hkiqdp0dt5hhe17akvbfjgt2&amp;topic=11164.0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.tinycorelinux.net/index.php?PHPSESSID=o9hkiqdp0dt5hhe17akvbfjgt2&amp;topic=11164.0&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://distro.ibiblio.org/tinycorelinux/welcome.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://distro.ibiblio.org/tinycorelinux/welcome.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nmd5sums : \n573305877ec642c9ceafcac512901c7f  microcore_3.8.1.iso\n523f2312f319a41068ffd809b961a979  multicore_3.8.1.iso\nbc6d9152eaa0c1d2853b41c2089cefeb  tinycore_3.8.1.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85e1a10877e46948d272aaa6d203ceb5199b0f77","amp;dn":"tiny+core+3.8.1+iso+files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85e1a10877e46948d272aaa6d203ceb5199b0f77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,225,161,8,119,228,105,72,210,114,170,166,210,3,206,181,25,155,15,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
