They'll tackle job creation, immigration rules, regulation, and they explain how they made it in business.\n\nSadly, all say that today, they could not do what they once did. That's sad, since these six alone built companies that employ more than 200,000 people. Today, they say, there are so many regulations that such entrepreneurship is nearly impossible.\n\nThe CEOs' perspective...that's our show this week.\n\nTom Stemberg, Staples Founder\nBrad Anderson, Former Best Buy CEO\nDavid Park, Austin Capital CEO\nJohn Allison, Former BB&amp;T CEO [uploader note: one of my fav. business ldrs]\nMike Whalen, Heart of America Group President\nStephen Zelnak, Marietta Materials Chairman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc685d693433d879a390908d95a289d445380f8d","amp;dn":"20111208-Stossel-%5BCreating+Jobs+2%5D-Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc685d693433d879a390908d95a289d445380f8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,104,93,105,52,51,216,121,163,144,144,141,149,162,137,212,69,56,15,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
