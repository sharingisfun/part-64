For this, he was arrested by Agent Roberts (Don Cheadle), convicted of computer crimes and spent two years in Leavenworth. A condition of his parole is that he is forbidden from touching, much less using, a computer. His ex-wife, Melissa (Drea de Matteo), has sole custody over their daughter Holly and a restraining order against Stanley from seeing Holly.While Stanley is at home in rural Texas practicing his golf swing, Ginger Knowles (Halle Berry) shows up to solicit his hacking skills for her boss Gabriel Shear (John Travolta). Stanley is apparently recruited at the last minute as a replacement for Gabriel's first choice, Axl Torvalds (Rudolf Martin), a European hacker of exceptional talent who was arrested by authorities at the airport. Torvalds is later assassinated by Gabriel's men before he can divulge anything about his assignment and who hired him to Agent Roberts. For an initial 100,000USD, Stanley agrees to meet with Gabriel. He and Ginger fly to Los Angeles and meet Gabriel in a night club. Gabriel pressures Stanley right then and there to hack a government system in 60 seconds while simultaneously being held at gun point by Gabriel's bodyguard and right hand man, Marco (Vinnie Jones) and receiving fellatio from a young woman. Although it was just a test (the gun was not loaded) Stanley succeeded in hacking the system, a feat that Gabriel had not anticipated.\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name:Swordfish 720p BRRip\nFormat:Matroska\nFile size:2013.65 MiB\nDuration:1h 39mn\nOverall bit rate:2 836 Kbps\nEncoded Date:UTC 2011-07-06 19:24:04\nSubtitles: Arabic,Danish,Dutch,English,French,German,Hindi,Norwegian,Portuguese,Spanish,Swedish,Vietnamese\nUse MPC player to view Hindi subs\n\n::Video Specification::\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type:x264 - core 115 r1995 c1e60b9\nAverage video bitrate:\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type:2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x544\nSource: Blu-ray\n\n::Audio Specification::\n\nAudio Language:English\nAudio Codec:AAC\nBitrate:%Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count:6 channels\nSample Rate:48.0 KHz\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/73815360099524971171.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/73815360099524971171.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/74837419030829114717.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/74837419030829114717.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/16734830123889129939.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/16734830123889129939.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/52445093122639350558.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/52445093122639350558.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/14467970758794658454.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/14467970758794658454.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/76596692306833222277.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/76596692306833222277.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8cd7c19f462a7eaecce94d2b3f34f29982c24d8","amp;dn":"Swordfish+720p+BRRip+Multi-Sub+vice+%28HDScene+Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8cd7c19f462a7eaecce94d2b3f34f29982c24d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,205,124,25,244,98,167,234,236,206,148,210,179,243,79,41,152,44,36,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
