Judge Napolitano will be away. Expect regular Freedom Watch listing to return after the 26th.\n\nFreedom Watch is a very timely current events show. As such, the shelf-life of individual episodes is rather limited. I maintain non-continuous root seeding for only three-weeks past air date, after which I dispose of older listings. I've been killing them off in this listing too, except recently delete here has broken. Don't expect a fill on older FW listings except by other community seeds. When delete/edit functions are finally fixed, old listings will be purged from here.\n\nI have hope that in the future, FW becomes somewhat less driven by the shallow 24hr-news cycle, and more focused in an analytical sense on core issues at the intersection of free-society and government, like much of what is seen on Stossel. I'd prefer to drill down thoughtfully into single-topic shows than try to cover everything happening now to a depth of only 1/4&quot;, night after night (and it's mostly the same topics night-to-night anyhow). I have become rather bored of Freedom Watch. Not yet bored enough to stop following, but enough to have grown a general malaise.\n\nFor something deeper, and in the direction I've love for Freedom Watch to go, I vigorously recommend Lew Rockwell's podcast!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lewrockwell.com/lewrockwell-show/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lewrockwell.com/lewrockwell-show/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n/rant]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df01a1069464f19934a4de29239cd65691628b15","amp;dn":"20110818-Freedom+Watch.Fox+Business+Network.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df01a1069464f19934a4de29239cd65691628b15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,1,161,6,148,100,241,153,52,164,222,41,35,156,214,86,145,98,139,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
