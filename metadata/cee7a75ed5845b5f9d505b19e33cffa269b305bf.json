Essentially he is concerned that a lot of the speculative material on that site does more harm than good and may tend to serve the disinformation agenda, as do other well-known &quot;TI&quot; websites such as raven1.net which was also previously archived.    I'm archiving this material because I want to be able to judge for myself and view the material in the future, even if a website gets taken down by its owner, if not a hostile external force.    But the podcasts in particular I recommend, as a great primer on the nature of the human rights abuses that are going on in our midst.\n\nAlso a few other odds and ends.\n\n\nFrom an associate of Jordan Maxwell.
