I think Indie is the beginning of a new musical era. Because its easy to miss a torrent (sometime PB is like a waist dump) I have grouped a few Dutch Treat playlists.  Just because they are simply the best playlists at the moment (For more HQ playlists search for Dutch Treat. I can recommend it. If nobody seeds, leave a message.)\n\nI have scrambled the numbers a bit because for me its more useful to group them as I1=Indie Easy, I2=Indie Mixed and I3=Indie Fast. I4 would be Indie Dance.\n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba248ec75b4d752d50f4fa231f793b7d0b4ed408","amp;dn":"Various+Artists+-+Best+Indie+Ever+Pack+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba248ec75b4d752d50f4fa231f793b7d0b4ed408","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,36,142,199,91,77,117,45,80,244,250,35,31,121,59,125,11,78,212,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
