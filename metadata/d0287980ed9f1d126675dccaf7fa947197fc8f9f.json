Danish.Finnish.French.Italian.Norwegian.Portuguese.Slovenian.Spanish.\n\nA 14th century Crusader returns to a homeland devastated by the Black Plague. A beleaguered church, deeming sorcery the culprit of the plague, commands the two knights to transport an accused witch to a remote abbey, where monks will perform a ritual in hopes of ending the pestilence. A priest, a grieving knight, a disgraced itinerant and a headstrong youth who can only dream of becoming a knight join a mission troubled by mythically hostile wilderness and fierce contention over the fate of the girl. When the embattled party arrives at the abbey, a horrific discovery jeopardises the knight's pledge to ensure the girl fair treatment, and pits them against an inexplicably powerful and destructive force.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0287980ed9f1d126675dccaf7fa947197fc8f9f","amp;dn":"Season+Of+The+Witch+2011.DK.FI.Fr.IT.NO.PT.SL.ES.Subtitles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0287980ed9f1d126675dccaf7fa947197fc8f9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,40,121,128,237,159,29,18,102,117,220,202,247,250,148,113,151,252,143,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
