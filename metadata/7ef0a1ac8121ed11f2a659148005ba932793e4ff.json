Bardgett, David A. Wardle, &quot;Aboveground-Belowground Linkages: Biotic Interactions, Ecosystem Processes, and Global Change (Oxford Series in Ecology and Evolution)&quot;\nPublisher: Oxford University Press, USA | ISBN 10: 0199546878 | 2010 | PDF | 320 pages | 4.3 MB\n\nboveground-Belowground Linkages provides the most up-to-date and comprehensive synthesis of recent advances in our understanding of the roles that interactions between aboveground and belowground communities play in regulating the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems, and their responses to global change. It charts the historical development of this field of ecology and evaluates what can be learned from the recent proliferation of studies on the ecological and biogeochemical significance of aboveground-belowground linkages.\n\nThe book is structured around four key topics: biotic interactions in the soil; plant community effects; the role of aboveground consumers; and the influence of species gains and losses. A concluding chapter draws together this information and identifies a number of cross-cutting themes, including consideration of aboveground-belowground feedbacks that occur at different spatial and temporal scales, the consequences of these feedbacks for ecosystem processes, and how aboveground-belowground interactions link to human-induced global change.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ef0a1ac8121ed11f2a659148005ba932793e4ff","amp;dn":"Aboveground-Belowground+Linkages","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ef0a1ac8121ed11f2a659148005ba932793e4ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,240,161,172,129,33,237,17,242,166,89,20,128,5,186,147,39,147,228,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
