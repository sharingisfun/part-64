It examines the possibility that neoconservatives used the September 11, 2001 attacks to usher in a new doctrine of expanding American power through military force under the guise of a &quot;war on terror&quot; and that the doctrine, known as the Project for the New American Century (PNAC), had been laid out prior to 9/11 by its authors, which include Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz, Donald Rumsfeld, Jeb Bush and Dan Quayle.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:602311cbd746ef384b0d6567560f6968e37ec5ac","amp;dn":"Hijacking+Catastrophe+%5B2004%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"602311cbd746ef384b0d6567560f6968e37ec5ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,35,17,203,215,70,239,56,75,13,101,103,86,15,105,104,227,126,197,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
