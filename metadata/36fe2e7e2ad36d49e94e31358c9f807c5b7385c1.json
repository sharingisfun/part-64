Musici of Italy\nwith other noted artists as indicated\n\nMy most favorite Bach piece is done by the talented Mr.Roberto Michelucci,\nit is the Bach Violin Concerto in A minor and I do hope you will enjoy that\nas the first part of this offering you might experience perhaps in order\nto find early satisfaction with your overall bandwidth investment.\n\nHe is also the best at doing Vivaldi's Four Seasons in my own view\n(he does so with the I. Musici group - together) and we will post\nthat CD offering for you too\n\nenjoy!\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmusicfromrizzo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36fe2e7e2ad36d49e94e31358c9f807c5b7385c1","amp;dn":"Bach+Brandenburg+%26+Violin+Concertos+I+Musici+%28musicfromrizzo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36fe2e7e2ad36d49e94e31358c9f807c5b7385c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,254,46,126,42,211,109,73,233,78,49,53,140,159,128,124,91,115,133,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
