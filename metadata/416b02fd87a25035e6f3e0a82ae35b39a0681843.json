This brief set -- only ten tracks -- is honed down to the very bones of things, but thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no filler to get in the way. Her biggest tracks are all here.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:416b02fd87a25035e6f3e0a82ae35b39a0681843","amp;dn":"Pat+Benatar+-+10+Great+Songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"416b02fd87a25035e6f3e0a82ae35b39a0681843","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,107,2,253,135,162,80,53,230,243,224,168,42,227,91,57,160,104,24,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
