The Lerners seemed to have\n                been universally loved, and there is not a single\n                lead which points to grievances against them - were\n                they really the intended victims? As crown\n                prosecutors Jake Thorne and Alesha Phillips try to\n                navigate a case in which the suspect has no apparent\n                motive or intent to commit the crime, can they make a\n                murder charge stick? Meanwhile, Jake's old mentor\n                Margaret Rumsfield argues that the accused should\n                only face manslaughter charges.\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78ea4dafa77f1179f0d0c30b4818912575ad6294","amp;dn":"Law.And.Order.UK.S05E05.720p.HDTV.x264-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78ea4dafa77f1179f0d0c30b4818912575ad6294","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,234,77,175,167,127,17,121,240,208,195,11,72,24,145,37,117,173,98,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
