DevExtras Print Screen enhances this screen capture functionality by providing on-screen selection to define exactly what is copied, an image editor to make minor adjustments/annotate the captured image and finally options on what to do with the image other than simply copying it to the clipboard.\n\nRelease Name: DevExtras.Print.Screen.v2.1.1-Lz0\nSize: 1.82 MB\n\nScreen:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:341c1464b1757a4f28d825f77451e26072bfe9f1","amp;dn":"DevExtras.Print.Screen.v2.1.1-%5B.Dude.%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"341c1464b1757a4f28d825f77451e26072bfe9f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,28,20,100,177,117,122,79,40,216,37,247,116,81,226,96,114,191,233,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
