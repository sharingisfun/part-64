He and his equally hopeless crew get into all kinds of \nscrapes with the local criminals. Oh, and it's a comedy. Hopelessly \nbroad and almost continually annoying, it's a film that it's hard to \nimagine even the target audience warming to. It's really just a torrent \nof age-old gags and clumsy, pointless situations dressed up with street \nslang. At least they didn't appear to have wasted much money on this, \nwhich is one of the few plus points.\n\nAlso, they can't spell Another. Morons.\n\nUtter shit.\n\nThe Preamble:\n\nMeet Kenneth. He thinks he's got the moves. He thinks \nhe's got swagger. He thinks he can spit bars. But in reality, \nhe's a wasteman!\n\nWith the bailiffs banging on the door, parents screaming in \nhis ear, and finding no luck with the ladies, he needs to fix \nup, and fast. When our boy starts selling weed to get himself \nout of trouble, local badman Tyrone is vex, opening up a world \nof hurt for Kenneth and his misfit crew. But he ain't gonna go \ndown without a fight. It s time for him to get rich, or cry trying!\n\nFrom the mind of Adam Deacon comes the UK's first hilarious \nurban comedy, with a BIG cast including Femi Oyeniran, Jaime \nWinstone, Ollie Barbieri, Richard Blackwood &amp; Ashley Walters, \nand featuring hot tunes from Tinie Tempah, Boy Better Know, Wiley \nand Dizzee Rascal. This ain't just any hood, it's Anuvahood!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c89bfb445b3b65be5ab45f596c3a6a65b4fb5c7","amp;dn":"Anuvahood.2011.LIMITED.720p.BluRay.x264-SCF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c89bfb445b3b65be5ab45f596c3a6a65b4fb5c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,137,191,180,69,179,182,91,229,171,69,245,150,195,166,166,91,79,181,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
