Ilona and her father, a professor who built a time machine, are sitting around when a thief breaks in and powers up unit. He is gone in a flash, set to travel back in time and change the world, but Ilona has other plans for him. She jumps into a second unit to stop him, and now the race is on. Can she stop the villain or will she be too late? Jump into the chase and help Ilona stop the rogue across different epochs.
