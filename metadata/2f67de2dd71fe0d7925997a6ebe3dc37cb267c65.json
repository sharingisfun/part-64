No efforts were made to improve the sound. Cheap cover art.\n  \n  Concert:   One of the best shows of this tour. Our man is in high spirits and he enjoys his time on the stage. Pitty that he wasn`t as good as here more often these days. We have a very good and interesting setlist with highlights like America The Beautiful, Hurt, Help Me, How Great Thou Art or You Gave Me A Mountain. Well done, Elvis ! \n\nWith covers. Enjoy!\n\nMore Elvis here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/burning.love/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/burning.love/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f67de2dd71fe0d7925997a6ebe3dc37cb267c65","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Heading+for+Tulsa+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f67de2dd71fe0d7925997a6ebe3dc37cb267c65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,103,222,45,215,31,224,215,146,89,151,166,235,227,220,55,203,38,124,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
