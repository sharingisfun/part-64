It could had been an excellent CD 5 - 6 years ago but now hardly essential. \nI also find very strange the producer would mention on the back cover that &quot; Night Rider &quot; take 1 never said to exist until now since it was released in 1990 on the BMG three CD set &quot;Collectors Gold&quot; !\nThese outtakes are released on several releases...but definitive not in this quality ! \n\nWith covers. Enjoy!\n\nMore Elvis you can find here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/burning.love/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/burning.love/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8c215ba2a6111880405647010042a1672000f0a","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Night+rider+%5C%2761+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8c215ba2a6111880405647010042a1672000f0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,194,21,186,42,97,17,136,4,5,100,112,16,4,42,22,114,0,15,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
