The visual palette includes grimy crucified dolls, fly-specked pig carcasses, body parts floating in murky jars, a tobacco-chewing redneck sheriff and many slender beams of sunlight cutting through dank, dusty interiors. The camera lovingly photographs Biel\\\\\\'s tank-topped bosom and sculpted abs as she\\\\\\'s running in terror from a bloated, chainsaw-wielding, human-skin-wearing maniac. This remake lacks the macabre comedy of the original; it\\\\\\'s all about the nauseating sensation of waiting for something to jump out of the dark. --Bret Fetzer\n\nwww.
