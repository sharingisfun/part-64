Why?\n\n1) Rounds 1 &amp; 2 (Australia &amp; Malaysia) are missing simply because I didn't had a video caputure by the time.\n2) Round 7 (Canada) is also incomplete. Globo TV has a very faulty Formula 1 coverage, which means they broadcast only the basic stuff. This race in particular was interrupted because of heavy rains, timing a little more than 4 hours after race start. Globo TV interrupted Formula 1 transmission to broadcast the Brazilian Football Championship (real football, not those thing americans so calls 'football'). The race re-started while the game was being transmitted. Globo TV just recovered Formula 1 broadcast by the 10 final laps, which by an accident I didn't recorded.\n\nPlease remember that this is the BRAZILIAN BROADCAST, so the audio will be mostly in brazilian portuguese.\n\nIf you have downloaded my videos along the year, you may download just 2 files:\n\n1) Round 03 (China): I cutted out the commercial breaks I left in the file, now it follows the standard I created.\n2) Round 19 (Brazil): I finally solved the problems and the file now doesn't have any commercial break.\n\nSpecial note for the trolls: I do that just because I love Formula 1 and I know many people around the world that miss the Formula 1 brazilian broadcast. It isn't perfect, it doesn't have profound technical details, but it is more emotional than most broadcasts around the world. If you want a better broadcast get the BBC video files and get the f**k out of here.\n\nAll files are MP4, resolution 640x360.\n\nFormula 1 - 2011 season - Round 03 - China Grand Prix\nSize: 965 MB\nDuration: 02:04:56\n\nFormula 1 - 2011 season - Round 04 - Turkey Grand Prix\nSize: 956 MB\nDuration: 01:48:34\n\nFormula 1 - 2011 season - Round 05 - Spain Grand Prix\nSize: 1.16 GB\nDuration: 01:58:19\n\nFormula 1 - 2011 season - Round 06 - Monaco Grand Prix\nSize: 1.44 GB\nDuration: 02:25:48\n\nFormula 1 - 2011 season - Round 07 - Canada Grand Prix [INCOMPLETE RECORDING]\nSize:  862 MB\nDuration: 1:58:31\n\nFormula 1 - 2011 season - Round 08 - Europe Grand Prix\nSize: 1.23 GB\nDuration: 01:58:53\n\nFormula 1 - 2011 season - Round 09 - Britain Grand Prix\nSize: 880 MB\nDuration: 01:48:07\n\nFormula 1 - 2011 season - Round 10 - Germany Grand Prix\nSize: 950 MB\nDuration: 01:53:48\n\nFormula 1 - 2011 season - Round 11 - Hungary Grand Prix\nSize: 1 GB\nDuration: 02:05:08\n\nFormula 1 - 2011 season - Round 12 - Belgium Grand Prix\nSize: 888 MB\nDuration: 01:41:22\n\nFormula 1 - 2011 season - Round 13 - Italy Grand Prix\nSize: 925 MB\nDuration: 01:38:59\n\nFormula 1 - 2011 season - Round 14 - Singapore Grand Prix\nSize: 1.05 GB\nDuration: 02:21:24\n\nFormula 1 - 2011 season - Round 15 - Japan Grand Prix\nSize: 975 MB\nDuration: 02:05:50\n\nFormula 1 - 2011 season - Round 16 - Korea Grand Prix\nSize: 1,06 GB\nDuration: 02:09:15\n\nFormula 1 - 2011 season - Round 17 - India Grand Prix\nSize: 791 MB\nDuration: 01:48:13\n\nFormula 1 - 2011 season - Round 18 - Abu Dhabi Grand Prix\nSize: 1.03 GB\nDuration: 01:53:37\n\nFormula 1 - 2011 season - Round 19 - Brazil Grand Prix\nSize: 1.16 GB\nDuration: 02:26:00","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38329c9d1578b0a2debe5942d44588c555f813e5","amp;dn":"2011+season+Formula+1+bundle+pack+%5Bpt-br%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38329c9d1578b0a2debe5942d44588c555f813e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,50,156,157,21,120,176,162,222,190,89,66,212,69,136,197,85,248,19,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
