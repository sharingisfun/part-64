In these thirteen essays and one remarkable extended interview, the man widely regarded as the most brilliant theoretical physicist since Einstein returns to reveal an amazing array of possibilities for understanding our universe.\n\nBuilding on his earlier work, Hawking discusses imaginary time, how black holes can give birth to baby universes, and scientistsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ efforts to find a complete unified theory that would predict everything in the universe. With his characteristic mastery of language, his sense of humor and commitment to plain speaking, Stephen Hawking invites us to know him betterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and to share his passion for the voyage of intellect and imagination that has opened new ways to understanding the very nature of the cosmos.\n\n\nRunning Time: 5:11:56\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daa45ad52553afa87145c5f5d72ee93e1719eb66","amp;dn":"Stephen+Hawking+-+Black+Holes+and+Baby+Universes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daa45ad52553afa87145c5f5d72ee93e1719eb66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,164,90,213,37,83,175,168,113,69,197,245,215,46,233,62,23,25,235,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
