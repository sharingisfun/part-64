The screenplay was written by Minder creator Leon Griffiths.\n\nLargely neglected, this production headlines a major cast made up of American actor Stacy Keach, and British actors Edward Fox and David Hemmings. Irish actor Stephen Boyd was also featured in a major role as a gangster.\n\nThe Squeeze is now considered a forgotten crime masterpiece that usually gets mentioned in books on British cinema of the 70's but usually gets overlooked in the light of Get Carter (1971) &amp; The Long Good Friday (1981).\n\nThe film also includes many location shots of the Ladbroke Grove area of London.\n\nStacy Keach ....
