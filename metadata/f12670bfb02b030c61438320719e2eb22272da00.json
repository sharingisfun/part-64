Consisting of members Eric Schmitz (vocals, guitar), Buz Zoller (guitar), Eric Faust (bass), and Pete Levine (drums), the band issued an independent, cassette-only release first, 1990's In the Toybox, before signing to the Zoo label and issuing two more albums -- 1992's Ka-Bloom (which the group toured behind with an opening slot on Blind Melon's spring 1993 U.S. tour) and 1995's People's Fuzz. Shortly thereafter, Flowerhead had gone the way of the buffalo.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f12670bfb02b030c61438320719e2eb22272da00","amp;dn":"Flowerhead+-+People%5C%27s+Fuzz+%281995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f12670bfb02b030c61438320719e2eb22272da00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,38,112,191,176,43,3,12,97,67,131,32,113,158,46,178,34,114,218,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
