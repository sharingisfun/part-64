The family eventually realizes there's more to Mr. Gordy than just a child's active imagination. Heidi awakens one night with claw marks on her face and her father Andy soon suffers the same scratches on his back. Mr. Gordy is no longer the only apparition; he's joined by a hooded, faceless figure and a man with one hand. The family contacts a parapsychologist who attributes the manifestations to energy from a fault-line. Later, a psychic tells them of several spirits in the home, some being good and some being evil. Eventually, they turn to their church for help.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:058ba80f6d586e1b2a03f962aea03a6a2ec1e30f","amp;dn":"A+HAUNTING+IN+GEORGIA+DVDRIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"058ba80f6d586e1b2a03f962aea03a6a2ec1e30f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,139,168,15,109,88,110,27,42,3,249,98,174,160,58,106,46,193,227,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
