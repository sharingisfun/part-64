But like many other performers who had little education and little familiarity with the music business or copyright law, Crudup fell victim to exploitation. Only after his death did his heirs finally succeed in securing his copyrights and long-overdue royalties.\nHis best known records included ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRock Me Mama,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMean Old 'Frisco Blues,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and three that were covered by Presley: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThat's All Right,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy Baby Left Me,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSo Glad You're Mine.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Crudup rarely played concerts or theaters until the blues revival of the 1960s, but he was a juke joint favorite in Mississippi, where he performed with Elmore James, Sonny Boy Williamson, and locals such as George Lee, Odell Lay, and Clyde Lay.\n\nTracklist:\n01.
