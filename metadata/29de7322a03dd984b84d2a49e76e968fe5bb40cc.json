I was incredibly psyched to get this disc and have listened to it quite regularly over the last 6 weeks or so.   It is a favorite of mine (and the whole house, for that matter, but I blogged about that already).   Playing this album for some of my students, they asked ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWho is Mikel Rouse?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½   I think the best answer would be ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMikel Rouse is todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Schubert with better operas.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½   That just about covers it.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLove comes to those who wait.   Those who wait for me.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe songs that make up this cycle all sound like effortless, high quality popular music.   Why songs like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWait For MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m So BlueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t on the radio, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll never know.   Binding the songs together are several AP new reports enmeshed with lyrics and other wonderful statements spoken with perfect inflection by Veanne Cox.   There is a veritable Gordion Knot of material here.   The disc is cyclic with melodic, textual, and rhythmic returns of events.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf you multiply my disappointment by the world, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll see what I mean.   Multiply that by the animals eaten.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe sound quality on the disc is amazing.   What sounds effortless is actually some of the most nuanced and intricately orchestrated music IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve encountered recently.   Every listen brings out something new, like Christina PawlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s trumpet playing.   There are times when you hear the trumpet but there are times when she is tucked into the texture.   With the exception of those that IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve already mentioned and Penelope ThomasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ backing vocals, Mikel Rouse performs everything.   Not only is he Schubert, he rivals Wagner in gesamtkunstwerk.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI look at human beings and I see a freak show.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe best thing about this music is how complicated the songs are without sounding Complicated.   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m So BlueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a rather weird song in many respects but you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know that when you hear it.   RouseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lyrics are so smart and tight in the verses that when the chorus is a simple ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m so blue/that I love youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ you can rest assured that he has exhausted any other way he might have had of saying the same thing.   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m So BlueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is also in a 7 beat meter but I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t realize that for about a month of repeated listening.   Other favorites of mine are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWait For Me,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSilence of Sound,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStar Chamber/Rose Woods,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStay in School,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe World Got Away.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe songs are catchy, appealing, and detailed that you will be singing them to yourself for a while (my 4-year-old daughter was singing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSilence of SoundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in the tub the other night).   You will also be mining the lyrics and such for Facebook and Twitter posts.   Chuck Norris wins.   Some songs are harder to get into.   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYawn FactoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was a tough sell on my ears but IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m into it now.   IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not a fan of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlue Book,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but I couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quite tell you why.   When I try, I end up telling you everything that I LIKE about ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStar Chamber/Rose Woods.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½   Galen BrownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s testimonial from last month can shed more light on this excellent disc.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve traded knowledge for tape decks and beer.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nI will point out that, with the holidays coming up, you have a music lover that would dig this disc a lot.   Everyone knows someone who will love this.   Do them the favor and pick up a copy for yourself.   Chuck Norris wins.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/02/20/mickel-rouse/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29de7322a03dd984b84d2a49e76e968fe5bb40cc","amp;dn":"Mikel+Rouse...Gravity+Radio%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29de7322a03dd984b84d2a49e76e968fe5bb40cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,222,115,34,160,61,217,132,184,77,42,73,231,110,150,143,229,187,64,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
