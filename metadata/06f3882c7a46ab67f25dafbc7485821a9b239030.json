It is a sequel to the 1991 Academy Award-winning film The Silence of the Lambs that returns Anthony Hopkins to his iconic role as serial killer Hannibal Lecter. Julianne Moore co-stars, taking over for Jodie Foster in the role of FBI Agent Clarice Starling.\n\nSet ten years after The Silence of the Lambs, the premise is that Lecter's only surviving victim, Mason Verger (portrayed by Gary Oldman), is determined to capture, torture, and kill him. The film's locations alternate between Italy and the U.S.\n\nHannibal was a highly anticipated sequel. It marked the third film appearance of Lecter.\n\nThe &quot;bumpy&quot; development of Hannibal drew a large amount of attention, with Silence of the Lambs director Jonathan Demme, screenwriter Ted Tally and actress Jodie Foster all eventually declining involvement.[1] Upon release, Hannibal broke box-office records in the United States, Australia, Canada and the UK in February 2001.[2]\n\nAUDIO:\n\nCodec - 0x0161 (WMA v2)\nBitRate -  128kb/s\nLanguage - English\n\nVIDEO:\n\nCodec - WMV2\nName of Video Codec - WMP v8\nAverage BitRate of Video Stream: 1433kb/s\nResolution - 720x540\nLength of Movie - 2:11:28\nSize: 1.43GB\n\n\n\nOTHER INFORMATION: \n\nThis is a DVDRip from my personal collection.
