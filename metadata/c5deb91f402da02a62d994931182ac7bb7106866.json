Like the previous installments, the gameplay's core mechanics are based on parkour movements, crowd-blending stealth, assassinations and melee fighting system. The combat system features several improvements and for the first time in the series, the game offers a multiplayer mode alongside 40+ hours of single-player gameplay.[7]\nThe game introduces a new management system: the player can recruit new members by destroying any of fifteen &quot;Borgia towers&quot; around Rome where papal troops are stationed, then rescuing disgruntled citizens in their districts from harassing guards. The player, as Ezio, can then send them to assignments around Europe or call them for support during missions (if they are not already occupied). Tasking the novice Assassins makes them gain experience, and the player is able to customize their appearance, skills and weapon training to some degree by spending the skill points they have earned. Assassins can die on missions, from which they will not return. Ezio masters new gadgets, such as Leonardo da Vinci's parachute, which can be used when jumping from tall buildings,[7] along with poison darts, a faster acting poison, a crossbow, and the ability to hold and throw heavier weapons like axes.\n\n\nEzio using the BAM system (Brotherhood Assist Move).\n\n\n\nThe primary setting is Rome, which has fallen into ruin due to the corrupt rule of the Borgia papacy and the Templars over the Papal States and concentrating all the wealth in the Vatican. Just like the town of Monteriggioni in Assassin's Creed II, the player is able to invest in the city and witness its development and unlock rewards.[8] The player has to conquer and destroy Borgia towers to free city zones from the family's influence.[7] Completing this unlocks new missions and opportunities. Rome is the biggest city ever created after the first two installments (Rome is three times bigger than Florence from Assassin's Creed II[7]) and includes five varied districts: Vatican, Downtown, Tiber, Country and Antique. Unlike the previous installments, travel between different cities or regions is no longer present, as most of the action in the game takes place around the city of Rome. Instead, a series of tunnel networks throughout the city allow the player to travel to different sectors of the city with ease. However players will be able to explore the entire city of Rome, visit a part of Navarre, Spain and Monteriggioni in the present day.\n\n\nThe combat system has been modified. Striking first and offensive actions are more deadly in Brotherhood than previous games where counter-attacks were the most efficient. Before, this made the player wait until the AI struck, which slowed down the pace of fighting. The AI in this game is thus more aggressive and enemies can attack simultaneously. To dispatch them, Ezio can use melee and ranged weapons at the same time, as well as introducing the hidden pistol in combat. After killing one enemy the player can start an execution streak to dispatch multiple enemies quickly. Ezio can throw heavy weapons (axes, spears, and swords) at his enemies. There are new enemy archetypes in addition to those seen in Assassin's Creed II such as horsemen, arquebusiers, papal guards and others.\nHorses play a larger role in Brotherhood, not only used as a means of transport (inside the city for the first time), but as a component of acrobatic sequences and advanced combat as well, allowing ranged weapons to be used while riding them. Brotherhood also introduces various types of horse-related assassinations, featuring horse-to-horse assassinations. There are environmental objects like the flower pot in Assassin's Creed II to move faster inside the city (a system of tunnels around the city allow fast travel), as well as new objects such as merchandise lifts to quickly climb up high buildings or structures.[9]\nUnlike previous installments, Desmond can leave the Animus at almost any time. This allows Desmond to explore the present-day town of Monteriggioni. The player is also offered virtual training, a mini-game where the player may test their free-running or combat skills.\n\n\n.......................................System requirements.........................\n\n\nMinimum System Requirements\n* OS: Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7\n* CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo 1.8 GHZ or AMD Athlon X2 64 2.4GHZ\n* RAM: 1.5 GB XP (or 2 GB for  Vista/7)\n* HDD: 8 GB free disk space\n* Graphics: 256 MB Graphics Memory with Shader Model 3.0\n* Sound Card: DirectX 9 Compatible\n* DirectX: Version 9.0c\nRecommended System Requirements\n* OS: Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7\n* CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo E6700 2.6 GHz or AMD Athlon 64 X2 6000+\n* RAM: 2 GB\n* HDD: 8 GB free disk space\n* Graphics: 512 MB Graphics Memory with Shader Model 3.0\n* Sound Card: DirectX 9 Compatible\n* DirectX: Version 9.0c\nSupported Graphics Cards:\nATI RADEON HD 2000/3000/4000/5000/6000 series,\nNVIDIA GeForce 8/9/100/200/300/400/500 series","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5deb91f402da02a62d994931182ac7bb7106866","amp;dn":"Assasin%5C%27s+creed+brotherhood+Directplay...","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5deb91f402da02a62d994931182ac7bb7106866","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,222,185,31,64,45,160,42,98,217,148,147,17,130,172,123,183,16,104,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
