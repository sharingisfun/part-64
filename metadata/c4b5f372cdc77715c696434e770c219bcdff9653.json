Ten years later, the story shifts to Igarashi Ganta, a seemingly ordinary student attending Nagano Prefecture\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s middle school. An escapee, a survivor of the great earthquake, Ganta has no memories of the tragedy and has lived a normal life. This all changes when a strange person covered in blood and crimson armour floats through his classroom windows. Grinning madly, the Red Man massacres Ganta\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s entire class but instead of killing him, embeds a red crystal shard in Ganta\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s chest. Within days of the massacre, Ganta is declared the sole suspect and, following a quick trial, is sentenced to life imprisonment in Deadman Wonderland, a massive theme park like prison.\n\nFull English subs, flv format, please seed ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4b5f372cdc77715c696434e770c219bcdff9653","amp;dn":"Deadman+Wonderland","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4b5f372cdc77715c696434e770c219bcdff9653","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,181,243,114,205,199,119,21,198,150,67,78,119,12,33,155,205,255,150,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
