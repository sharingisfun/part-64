Kubelik certainly believed Mahler was worth the effort as this recording from early in his career and at what must have been near the time when Furtwangler heard him proves. As a performance this is the best of KubelikÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s three available recordings. An archive recording all Mahlerites should own for the young Kubelik and for the old Concertgebouw. The fact that it is in mono should be noted but, on this occasion, I am not letting that fact get in the way of including it as a main recommendation.&quot;\n\nRead the whole artice at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.musicweb-international.com/Mahler/Mahler5.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.musicweb-international.com/Mahler/Mahler5.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n&quot;An outstanding, live 1951 performance, with Concertgebouw orchestra.
