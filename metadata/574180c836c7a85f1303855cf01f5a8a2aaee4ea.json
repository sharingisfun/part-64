Basically, you must Re-run STARTXP.bat in $OEM$ folder of CD.  It doesn't fully apply during installation and includes tweaks and apps.  When prompted to overwrite files enter the letter A.  Then restart your computer, and your good to go.  Obviously, you want to install your drivers and .net AIO for app dependencies.  Then you can go straight to installing your apps, or choose &quot;Portable Apps Platform&quot; or &quot;Ninite&quot; to install mass volumes of free apps easily. Oh and don't mind the million spelling mistakes.

Then start the virtual machine, click on &quot;Virtual Machine&quot;, &quot;Removable Device&quot;, &quot;CD/DVD, &quot;settings&quot;.  Select use iso.  Browse to image file, press ok, and restart the virtual machine.\nThis time, you will avoid having to put in a serial number, and you will also avoid Error Code: 0x80070002 upon first XP startup. You see - easy install bypasses one of my important manual install procedures, that's why you get that error.\n\n[b]Past Releases Sizes:[/b]\n\n0.88\t206.95 MB\n0.90\t262 MB\n0.91\t217 MB\n0.92\t217 MB\n0.95\t211 MB (with 16 apps) \n   \n[b]I don't want to install XP on C Drive?[/b]\n\nYou have three options.\nMake sure only one storage unit is connected to computer prior to loading XP Setup; optical drive doesn't count.\n1. If you see another partition, select that partition.\n2. If there are no partitions, then you must create two partitions.\n    By default when you go to make a partition, XP gives the maximum size.\n    You need to reduce this size so that you can make a second partition.\n    Now create you second partition, and select it to install XP onto it.\n3. If there is exactly one partition, it is probably taking the whole hard drive, and you need to delete then create two partitions as discussed.\nNote: Sandboxie and Foxit Creator will not install properly if you choose alternative drive.  Everything else though will be fine.\n\n[b]Exaustive List of Removed Features, and Reason for Removal:[/b]\n\tNo Device AutoPlay \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Security)\n \tNo Posix support; used by hackers/malware \t\t\t\t\t\t(Security)\n \tNo Floppy/Zip/Iomega/Tape Drive/Serial Port support\t\t\t\t\t(Irrelevant)\n \tNo Visiting Windows update*\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(No Need)\n \tNo Password Storage, except for internet connection/user login\t\t\t\t(Security)\n \tNo Terminal Services/Remote Desktop/Remote Registry/\n                 /Netmeeting/Telnet/FastUserSwitch**\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Security)\n \tNo Internet Information Service (aka Apache)\t\t\t\t\t\t(Irrelevant)\n \tNo Windows Sounds \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Annoying)\n \tNo Multi-language windows dialog boxes \t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Irrelevant)\t\t\n\tNo Secondary Logon\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Security)\n \tNo QOS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Security) \n \tNo FAT to NTFS converter, File and Settings Wizard, Help and Support\t\t\t(Useless)\n\tNo Indexing*** (Increased general performance, slower search results, use Everything to search)\n            No Upgrade installation\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Useless)\n\n*The bulk of your security is in your security software (Anti-Virus, Virtualization, Firewall) not in XP updates.\n**Terminal Services allows users to connect interactively to a remote computer i.e., netmeeting.  It's removal provides security  \n  benefits.  Despite it playing no role in the following software, the software fails to install and therefore earn my Award for\n  Garbage software packages:  Toshiba Notebook Utilities, Windows Search 4.0, Norton Antivirus 2003.\n***I recommend install Everything via Ninite to search for files; XP search is slow. \n****No other removed component affects application compatibility.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:574180c836c7a85f1303855cf01f5a8a2aaee4ea","amp;dn":"Micro+XP+Pro+0.95","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"574180c836c7a85f1303855cf01f5a8a2aaee4ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,65,128,200,54,199,168,95,19,3,133,92,240,31,90,138,42,174,228,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
