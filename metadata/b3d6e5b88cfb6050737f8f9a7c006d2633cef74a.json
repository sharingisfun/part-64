These images are most often created by reading the floppy and cassette media with original hardware and transferring the data to modern PCs via specially made cables.\n\nAt the outset let us state that we think this will have limited appeal, being most valuable to hardcore scene collectors who are researching scene history or scavenging specific kinds of releases and files for focused collections they may be putting together. But we'll try to answer the most obvious questions regarding why we're undertaking this, what our approach is, and why we think this is a valuable step in the quest for c64/scene history preservation.\n\nGoals:\npreservation\ngather, track and index media image collections\navailability\nmaintain an up to date directory of download links with stable mirrors\norganization\ndevise a simple and concise way of referring to individual media images across all collections\nproduce metadata for each collection that may improve browsing, searching, and sorting\nidentify duplicate media images (future)\nidentify empty media images / corrupt transfers (future)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3d6e5b88cfb6050737f8f9a7c006d2633cef74a","amp;dn":"Scenebase+Collection%3A+Commodore+64+Diskimages+%28D64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3d6e5b88cfb6050737f8f9a7c006d2633cef74a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,214,229,184,140,251,96,80,115,127,143,154,124,0,109,38,51,206,247,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
