I just package it nicely for you to use.  The POIs include:\n\n1. two sources of all redlight cameras in the USA\n2. two sources of all speed cameras in the USA\n3. one source of all locations that police often use for setting up speed traps\n\nIf your Garmin Nuvi has the capability to play MP3 files, then you will hear appropriate warnings when 600 feet from these locations.\n\nThe above is current as of July 2011.\n\nOther POIs included in the SDHC folder are:\n1. All hospitals in the USA\n2. All highway rest areas in the USA\n3. All 2meter amateur radio repeaters in the USA\n4. All airports in the USA\n\nThere are no proximity alarms for these 4 POIs, but you can search for the nearest ones in your GPS.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b0139ff4a85cf5b88313839ec3324f94b58408b","amp;dn":"Gamin+Nuvi+SDHC+card+Redlight+%26+Speed+cameras+%26+enforcement+zone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b0139ff4a85cf5b88313839ec3324f94b58408b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,1,57,255,74,133,207,91,136,49,56,57,236,51,36,249,75,88,64,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
