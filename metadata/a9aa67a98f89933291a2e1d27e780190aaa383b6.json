Lumbering comedy-drama adapted from a Graham Greene novel is heavily padded with pinched, salty wit and lots of gossipy chit-cat and theatrical flair. It can't compensate for a lack of substance in the story, nor that Smith is too smart of an actress to be completely convincing as this merry madcap. George Cukor directed, with a heavy hand. Lou Gossett and Cindy Williams are both fine in support, but the movie is a featherweight farce undercut by faded-memory pathos. More heart and humor would have sufficed\n\nTitle: Travels_with_my_aunt_DVD9\nSize: 4.42 Gb - DVD-9\nEnabled regions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\nPlay Length: 01:49:17\n  Video: NTSC 16:9 (720x480) VBR, Auto Letterboxed\n  Audio:\n      Russian (Dolby AC3, 2 ch)\n      English (Dolby AC3, 2 ch)\n  Subtitles:\n      Russian\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9aa67a98f89933291a2e1d27e780190aaa383b6","amp;dn":"Travels+with+My+Aunt+%281972%29+DVD9+ENG+RUS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9aa67a98f89933291a2e1d27e780190aaa383b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,170,103,169,143,137,147,50,145,162,225,210,126,120,1,144,170,163,131,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
