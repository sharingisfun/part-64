No need to resort to some Virtual PC trickery to get the files installed, they are included in a seperate folder in this torrent along with the disc images.\n\nJust mount the disc images with your tool of choice (i used Daemon Tools Lite myself) and run ydkj32.exe to play. People with stupidly high screen resolutions may wanna dial it down a few notches as otherwise you'll have to play in a small box in the center of the screen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9b9099afec25685ea118a9add6ff6ca3129dadb","amp;dn":"You+Don%5C%27t+Know+Jack%21+UK+Version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9b9099afec25685ea118a9add6ff6ca3129dadb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,185,9,154,254,194,86,133,234,17,138,154,221,111,246,202,49,41,218,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
