An American tourist with a boat is        \n    robbed by a gang of teenager boys, assisted by the leader's sister.      \n    But soon afterward she jumps to the victim's boat to escape her          \n    brother's incestuous jealousy. The couple fly together and is hunted     \n    by the entire gang. Both happen to enter high-classified military        \n    territory. There might be a third and atomic world war, after which      \n    no ordinary man could survive. But now and then children are born who    \n    are &quot;naturally&quot; radio-active and have cold blood. They might survive     \n    in the post-war world and carry on mankind. They are fetched and         \n    brought to an underground construction where they are educated by TV.    \n    They are told that they are on a space ship moving toward the earth,     \n    which they should eventually colonize. This military project seems to    \n    be a failure because of a high mortality among the children. - The       \n    military soon finds the gang. The couple finds the children and tries    \n    to help them to escape. This situation will develop into                 \n    psychological and other horror.                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
