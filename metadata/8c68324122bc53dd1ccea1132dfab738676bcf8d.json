Off the Straight &amp; Narrow is the first in-depth documentary to cast a critical eye over the growth of gay images on TV. Leading media scholars provide the historical and cultural context for exploring the social implications of these new representations. \n\nOff the Straight &amp; Narrow challenges viewers to consider the value and limits of available gay images: who is represented, what they get to say, and how people respond to them. The video is an invaluable tool for all educators interested in introducing students to issues of representation and diversity in the media. \n\nKatherine Sender is Assistant Professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. She is author of Business, not Politics: The Making of the Gay Market, which was nominated for 2006 International Communication Association Best Book Award. She has also published numerous articles, including the forthcoming Dualcasting: Bravo's Gay Programming and the Quest for Women Audiences and Professional Homosexuals: The Politics of Sexual Identification in Gay and Lesbian Media and Marketing.
