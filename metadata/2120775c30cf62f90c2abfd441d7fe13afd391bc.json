But behind many a hero is a good-for-nothing younger brother trying just to stay out of the way of those dragons, evil and trouble in general. Danny McBride and James Franco team up for an epic comedy adventure set in a fantastical world-Your Highness. As two princes on a daring mission to save their land, they must rescue the heir apparentÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e before their kingdom is destroyed. Thadeous (McBride) has spent his life watching his perfect older brother Fabious (Franco) embark upon valiant journeys and win the hearts of his people. Tired of being passed over for adventure, adoration and the throne, heÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s settled for a life of wizardÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s weed, hard booze and easy maidens. But when FabiousÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ bride-to-be, Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel), gets kidnapped by the evil wizard Leezar (Justin Theroux), the king gives his deadbeat son an ultimatum: Man up and help rescue her or get cut off. Half-assedly embarking upon his first quest, Thadeous joins Fabious to trek across the perilous outlands and free the princess. Joined by Isabel (Natalie Portman)-an elusive warrior with a dangerous agenda of her own-the brothers must vanquish horrific creatures and traitorous knights before they can reach Belladonna. If Thadeous can find his inner hero, he can help his brother prevent the destruction of his land. Stay a slacker, and not only does he die a coward, he gets front row seats to the dawn of an all-new Dark Ages.\n\n\nCast:\nDanny McBride ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Thadeous\nJames Franco ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Fabious\nRasmus Hardiker ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Courtney\nNatalie Portman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Isabel\nToby Jones ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Julie\nJustin Theroux ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Leezar\nZooey Deschanel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Belladonna\nCharles Dance ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ King Tallious\nDamian Lewis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Boremont\nSimon Farnaby ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Manious the Bold\nDeobia Oparei ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Thundarian\n\nVideo Specifications:\nFormat: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\nBitrate: 1949 kbps\nFramerate: 23.976 FPS\nEncoder: x264\nResolution: 1280x544\nAspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nAdvanced Encoding: 2-Pass Encoding\nQuality Factor (QF): 0.117\n\nAudio Specifications:\nFormat: AAC-LC\nBitrate:AAC-LC = 128 kbps / AAC 5.1 = 300 kbps\nBitrate Mode: Adaptive\nChannels: AAC-LC= 2 (Stereo) / AAC 5.1 = 6 channels (3/2 .1)\nSample Rate: 48000Hz [Both]\nSubtitles: English - Spanish - French\nSample: YES\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img.release-lounge.com/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/yourhighness2011720pbrripareleaseloungeh264_2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img.release-lounge.com/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/yourhighness2011720pbrripareleaseloungeh264_2.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img.release-lounge.com/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/yourhighness2011720pbrripareleaseloungeh264_1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img.release-lounge.com/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/yourhighness2011720pbrripareleaseloungeh264_1.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img.release-lounge.com/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/yourhighness2011720pbrripareleaseloungeh264.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img.release-lounge.com/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/yourhighness2011720pbrripareleaseloungeh264.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCompatiblilty: PS3, Popcorn Hour, WD &amp; XBOX 360\nThe MP4 contains 2 audio channels, 6 Channel and 2 Channel.
