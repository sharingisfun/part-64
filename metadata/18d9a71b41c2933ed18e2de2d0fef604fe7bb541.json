Get a friend and grab your mallets to see who dominates the table in 2-player mode. Try off the wall banks &amp; combos to spoil your opponent\\\\\\'s defenses and be the first to score 7 points - just like in real air hockey!\n\nYou\\\\\\'ll play with easy to control mallets that aren\\\\\\'t too big or small and a puck that rockets across the table. The goals are sized to perfectly balance rapid game play and the challenge of the game. Advanced physics and air hockey sounds make the game act and sound like you\\\\\\'re playing on a real table!\n\nAir Hockey by Acceleroto.
