As with previous games in the series, players must destroy the environment to earn points. Other actions are available in addition to destroying buildings; people can be eaten and players can also throw vehicles to cause more damage. New to the series is the ability to climb on the front of a building to destroy it. Hidden in each city are tokens which, when eaten, will unlock new characters and special abilities. Playing well fills a character\\'s special meter which can be used to utilize special abilities such as Rampage mode or the Roar power.\n\nTotal Destruction features four game modes. The first is a campaign in which players work to progressively take out cities around the world. King of the City and King of the World are competitive modes where up to four players compete. In King of the City, players strive to rule a city by dominating the most districts. King of the World is a series of King of the City competitions across various cities. The fourth mode is a time trial where players must complete all the districts of a city within a time limit.\n\nPlatform: PS2\nLanguage: English\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:beafa3f29e1fbdaffbbd3e559ca4999adc4eb4de","amp;dn":"Rampage+Total+Destruction+%5BNTSC%5D+PS2+-+Snake2099","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"beafa3f29e1fbdaffbbd3e559ca4999adc4eb4de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,175,163,242,158,31,189,175,251,189,62,85,156,164,153,154,220,78,180,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
