The show features auctioneer Dan Dotson, as well as auction hunters Dave Hester, Darrell Sheets, Barry Weiss, and Jarrod Schulz. When rent is not paid on a storage locker for three months in California, the contents are sold by an auctioneer as a single lot of items. The show follows professional buyers who purchase the contents based only on a 5 minute inspection and what they can see only from the door when it is opened. The goal is to turn a profit on the merchandise.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3631f544881e55c6193ac97feba9d1a64b22c1e","amp;dn":"Storage.Wars.S02E05._.XviD-sHoTV.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3631f544881e55c6193ac97feba9d1a64b22c1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,99,31,84,72,129,229,92,97,147,172,151,254,186,157,26,100,178,44,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
