The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, which circumscribed a wide area (later known as the &quot;death strip&quot;) that contained anti-vehicle trenches, &quot;fakir beds&quot; and other defenses. The Soviet-dominated Eastern Bloc officially claimed that the wall was erected to protect its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the &quot;will of the people&quot; in building a socialist state in East Germany. However, in practice, the Wall served to prevent the massive emigration and defection that marked Germany and the communist Eastern Bloc during the post-World War II period.\n\nIn 1989, a radical series of political changes occurred in the Eastern Bloc, associated with the liberalization of the Eastern Bloc's authoritarian systems and the erosion of political power in the pro-Soviet governments in nearby Poland and Hungary. After several weeks of civil unrest, the East German government announced on 9 November 1989 that all GDR citizens could visit West Germany and West Berlin. Crowds of East Germans crossed and climbed onto the wall, joined by West Germans on the other side in a celebratory atmosphere. Over the next few weeks, a euphoric public and souvenir hunters chipped away parts of the wall; the governments later used industrial equipment to remove most of the rest. The fall of the Berlin Wall paved the way for German reunification, which was formally concluded on 3 October 1990.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a82ddbd0d98b8f32e3c909fd0705ba1b2be00fe4","amp;dn":"The+Berlin+Wall+%28TV%29+%5B2003%5D+Modern+Marvels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a82ddbd0d98b8f32e3c909fd0705ba1b2be00fe4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,45,219,208,217,139,143,50,227,201,9,253,7,5,186,27,43,224,15,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
