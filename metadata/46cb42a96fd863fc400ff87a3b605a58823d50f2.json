Unfortunately, SkyNet does send another one back - and this one is called the T-X, even more powerful &amp; advanced than the dreaded T-1000. However, another CSM-101 Terminator is also sent back to protect John against the T-X. Now, Skynet is patiently assuming control of civilian computer systems, under the guise of a computer virus. John has also met his future wife, Kate Brewster, whose father - a U.S. Air Force General - is in charge of the military computer systems &amp; is leery of up linking SkyNet. However, when the SkyNet virus infects the U.S military computers &amp; leaves the country open to attack, the machines begin their horrific takeover. Soon a nuclear war will result - and the war against the machines will begin. Can the outdated CSM-101 Terminator eliminate the highly advanced T-X...\n\n\n\nImdb:       &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181852/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181852/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n             Users: (119,558 votes) 1,614 reviews | Critics: 259 reviews \n             \n             Imdb: 6.6/10\n\nRuntime:     109 min\n\nYear:        2003\n\nGengre:      Action | Sci-Fi\n \nScource:     Dvd| Retail |Pal\n\nRars:        No\n\nSubs:        Arabic\n             Bulgarian\n             Danish\n             English\n             Finnish\n             Greek\n             Hebrew\n             Hindi\n             Icelandic\n             Croatian\n             Norwegian\n             Polish\n             Serbian\n             Slovenian\n             Swedish\n             Czech\n             Turkish\n             \n             \nAudio:       English 5.1\n             Czech\n             Polish\n \nImage:       Widescreen 2.40:1\n\nExtras:      Yes\n\nFormat:      Dvd\n\nMenu:        Yes\n\nStripped     No\n\nDirector:    Jonathan Mostow\n\nWriters:     James Cameron\n             Gale Anne Hurd \n\nStars:       Arnold Schwarzenegger\n             Nick Stahl \n             Kristanna Loken\n\n\n\n \n\n                     ENJOY COMMENT &amp; SEED!
