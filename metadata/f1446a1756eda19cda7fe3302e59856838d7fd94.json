Requires iOS 3.0 or later\n\n\n\n\n'Eve of the Genesis'\n\nWay, way back, the Empire of Gadalia, a mighty state, controlled the lands in which the game is set, and the islands around those lands.\nThat empire was ruled by mechanical beings in the form of men, and the humans were under their control.\nIt is unclear from what period humans fell under the control of the machines.\nThere is the legend that robots came down from the heavens, but so long has passed now that to be certain of how things began is nigh on impossible.\n\n'Why must humans be subject to those with no blood in their veins?'- Finally, this ill-feeling led to the humans raising the flag of revolt against the machines.\n\nThe clashes between humans and machines developed into a huge war that engulfed each and every land, with no victory in sight. Into this stalemate the machines introduced the strongest killing machine of all, designed to achieve ultimate victory: the Eve of Zero...\n\nNow, 2000 years laterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Â  A simple and classic RPG\n\nEasy and fun to play, for anyone from beginners to seasoned gamers.\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Â  Beautiful, old-style graphics\n\nThe dungeons contain many traps, and are satisfyingly challenging.
