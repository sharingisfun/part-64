Expressing controversial or unpopular opinions has sometimes caused people to be silenced by others, and in the wake of the 9/11 terrorists attacks, some Americans have found that speech isn't always as free as they'd imagine. Shouting Fire, a riveting exploration of the current state of free speech in America is crucially relevant. Interweaving historical cases-The New York Times' fight to publish the Pentagon Papers and the Nazis' insistence on marching in Skokie, IL. among them-with contemporary free-speech battles, the film documents the way both the Right and the Left have lashed out in fear. We think of First Amendment rights as inviolable; but in fact, they're profoundly vulnerable. Prominent First Amendment attorney--and the filmmaker's father-Martin Garbus, leads us through this perilous landscape and wisely warns, if we don't fight for our freedoms every day, we will lose them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faf95f1cd5406b4c8f52a4fbfadbe48a740af276","amp;dn":"Shouting+Fire+Stories+From+the+Edge+of+Free+Speech.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faf95f1cd5406b4c8f52a4fbfadbe48a740af276","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,249,95,28,213,64,107,76,143,82,164,251,250,219,228,138,116,10,242,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
