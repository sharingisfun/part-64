Simply stated, it is an emotional version of acupuncture except needles aren\\'t necessary. Instead, you stimulate well established energy meridian points on your body by tapping on them with your fingertips. The process is easy to memorize and is portable so you can do it anywhere. It launches off the EFT Discovery Statement which says...\n\n\\&quot;The cause of all negative emotions is a disruption in the body\\'s energy system.\\&quot;\n\nAnd because our physical pains and diseases are so obviously connected with our emotions the following statement has also proven to be true...\n\n\\&quot;Our unresolved negative emotions are major contributors to most physical pains and diseases.\\&quot;\n\nThis common sense approach draws its power from (1) time-honored Eastern discoveries that have been around for over 5,000 years and (2) Albert Einstein, who told us back in the 1920\\'s that everything (including our bodies) is composed of energy. These ideas have been largely ignored by Western Healing Practices and that is why EFT often works where nothing else will. As you will clearly see, conventional healing methods have overlooked the obvious.\n\n\nMore benefits await you...\n\n* You can make enormous strides by introducing EFT into your therapy process (whether you are a professional or a client). Instead of taking months or years using conventional \\&quot;talk therapy,\\&quot; EFT often does the job for you cleanly and thoroughly in one or two sessions ... and sometimes does it in moments. We label these latter near-instant results as \\&quot;one minute wonders.\\&quot; Do EFT properly and you will likely experience them 50% of the time.\n* Once you have seen how well EFT clears out emotional debris, your next step is to notice how physical ailments start to fade. Headaches, back pains and other discomforts tend to improve or vanish. Your vision may become clearer and everyday stress takes less toll on your system. Check out the EFT at Work section for an impressive list of both emotional and physical healings.\n* Accordingly, you can use it for just about everything. That is one of the most astonishing things about it. You use the same basic procedure for your fear of public speaking as you do for improving your golf score. You can also use it for everything from the common cold to cancer. Further, we have had success with nearly every emotional issue on the books...including fear, trauma, depression, grief and schizophrenia. That is why you can consider it the missing link in your pursuit of health and happiness. Once you truly recognize the Universal nature of EFT you will eagerly join our growing throng of enthusiasts. There is nothing like it, anywhere.\n\nPossible EFT limitations\n\nI\\'m not saying here that EFT is perfect. We don\\'t get 100%. But it usually works well and the results are sometimes spectacular. It often works where nothing else will and it represents a Doorway to your new Healing High-Rise.\n\nYou will find that EFT is usually quite gentle and you can often achieve substantial relief with little or no pain. This is not true for everyone, however.Some people\\'s issues are so intense that the mere mention of them causes emotional or physical pain. But, given time, even these are often resolved efficiently with EFT.\n\nA small percentage of our population (best estimate is less than 3%) have serious emotional disabilities and thus newcomers to EFT are advised to exercise common sense in this regard. While you can use EFT to generate impressive relief for the vast majority of the world\\'s population, please don\\'t go where you aren\\'t qualified.\n\n-[i]Gary Craig[/i]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8127a3db354f655b5a397933b19f4bfc313baffc","amp;dn":"The.EFT.Course.DVDRip.XviD-VViNNi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8127a3db354f655b5a397933b19f4bfc313baffc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,39,163,219,53,79,101,91,90,57,121,51,177,159,75,252,49,59,175,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
