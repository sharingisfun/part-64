Specifically Chapters 2 through 4 are devoted to basic theory of periodic and transient signals, the statistics behind random processes and the concept of linear transmission systems. Chapters 5 through 13 cover the fundamentals of digital communications and include sampling and multiplexing, baseband transmission over metallic lines, decision and information theory and error control coding. This second part also includes a description of the many sophisticated bandpass modulation schemes, the calculation of the received power and associated signal-to-noise ratio in a practical communications link, and an indication how the performance of a system can be accessed by simulation, before the actual construction is attempted.\n\nThe third part, Chapters 14 through 16, extends the previous link budget analysis to fixed point-to-point terrestial and satellite based microwave communication systems as well as mobile and cellular radio communication and video (TV) transmission and storage. The fourth part, Chapters 17 through 21, is devoted to communication networks. This starts with a discussion of network topologies, access techniques and their signalling and routing protocols and architectures before moving on to queueing theory. It then progresses naturally to public networks, SDH and ISDN, the internationally agreed standard for the worldwide digital telecommunications network before finally concluding with broadcast networks, both wired and wireless local area networks. This completely revised and extended networks section in the second edition introduces the reader to a range of rapidly evolving wireless networking techniques.\n\nThis book is aimed at readers who are completing a graduate level B.Eng./M.Eng. first degree course in Communications, Electronics or Electrical Engineering. It is assumed that these readers will have competence in the mathematical concepts explored in earlier courses in basic mathematical techniques, to handle comfortably the material in Part One.\n\nWe have deliberately extended our coverage of digital communications to include the practical aspects of the implementation of digital PCM, SDH, packet speech systems as well as examining the capability of optical and microwave long-haul communication systems. With this balance between theory, applications and systems implementation we hope that this text will be readily used both in academia and in the rapidly growing mobile communications industry. \n\n\n\n\n3rd Edition China Machine Press, 2010\n\nISBN 978-7-111-31669-5, 1024 pages ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7a20f5bf8bb70265e26c66f18eb844d1c7da049","amp;dn":"Digital+Communications+3rd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7a20f5bf8bb70265e26c66f18eb844d1c7da049","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,162,15,91,248,187,112,38,94,38,198,111,24,235,132,77,28,125,160,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
