Their rivalry grows into a wary friendship once they become fellow fighter pilots in World War I. Director William A. Wellman had the full cooperation of the U.S. War Department, which allowed him to film spectacular aerial dogfight scenes. Gary Cooper appears as a veteran pilot.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27e5289c839393f838b40f4f79aae1ffaabe431b","amp;dn":"Wings+%281927%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27e5289c839393f838b40f4f79aae1ffaabe431b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,229,40,156,131,147,147,248,56,180,15,79,121,170,225,255,170,190,67,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
