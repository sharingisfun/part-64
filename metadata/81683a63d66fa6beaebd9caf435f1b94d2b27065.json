He was trained under Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters and played harp in John Lee Hooker's Coast to Coast Blues Band for several years. Bob jammed with everyone in Chicago including Buddy Guy and Slim Harpo, which earned him the nickname Chicago Bob \n\nNelson's singing and playing is in prime form, he plays the blues the way it was meant to be played-from the heart. Known for his dynamic harmonica skills, all of Bob's past records have been electric Chicago blues, however, 'Tell Me Mama' is an album that features his down-home acoustic blues playing. This album represents BobÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s favorite type of blues, the blues that is relaxing and easy to listen to.\n\nTracklist\n\n01. Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\n02. Rats in My Kitchen\n03.
