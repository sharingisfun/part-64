Jakszyk is an English guitarist, singer-songwriter , multi-instrumentalist and producer (as well as being an occasional comedian and raconteur). In addition to pursuing a solo career, he has been a member of Level 42, 64 Spoons, The Lodge, The Tangent &amp; 21st Century Schizoid Band and has collaborated with a variety of other musicians including Tom Robinson, Robert Fripp, Gavin Harrison &amp; Dave Stewart as well as having an extensive and well-respected career as a session musician. He is frequently referred to simply as \\&quot;Jakko\\&quot; and several of his releases are credited to this shorter name.\nJakko and Harrison\\'s work on The Kings Of Oblivion project led to a more serious band in the shape of Dizrhythmia, a project mixing jazz, folk, art-rock and Indian music. Jakko served as main songwriter, singer, guitarist (including the use of \\&quot;sitar guitar\\&quot;), flute player and occasional keyboardist, with Harrison on drumkit, former Pentangle member, Danny Thompson on double bass and Pandit Dinesh on tabla and Indian percussion. Dizrhythmia\\'s self-titled album was released in 1988 for the Antilles label and featured a wealth of guest musical talent. In addition to contributions from Lyndon Connah, Dave Stewart and pedal steel guitarist BJ Cole, Pandit Dinesh had brought in several highly-regarded Indian classical musicians such as Sultan Khan. The album gained good press attention but the band - for unexplained reasons - did not follow up on this. The possibility of a second Dizrhythmia album has frequently been raised during the intervening years, but not pursued (apparently due to the busy schedules of all four core members).\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n01.
