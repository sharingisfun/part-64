Next, our drivers are put to the ultimate test as they try to manoeuvre themselves through the tight corners of the Cross. Then, its time for &quot;the worst&quot; to put the pedal to the metal as they deal with reversing and speed at the same time in our Reverse Slalom Challenge.\n\nFinally, the group gets behind the wheel of a huge cube truck. After fastening their seatbelts, they attempt to make a special delivery.\n\nOne driver will return to Canadian roads again after showing an improvement and our experts continue to watch closely to determine who will be Canada's Worst Driver.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7629ddf2df48266640728892faf4564cde46dcf3","amp;dn":"Canada%5C%27s+Worst+Driver+S07E07","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7629ddf2df48266640728892faf4564cde46dcf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,41,221,242,223,72,38,102,64,114,136,146,250,244,86,76,222,70,220,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
