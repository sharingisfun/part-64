Formed in 2008 in the small village of Cisco Illinois (pop. 300) by Aaron Blythe and Josh Winters, the duo wrote and recorded 6 tracks for their first EP (nearly 31 minutes) &quot;Warrior Style&quot; in early 2009. Soon the duo had expanded to a trio, in preparation for live performance, w...ith the addition of Erich Hehn (Bass, Vocals). The track &quot;Truel&quot;, featuring drumming from Mike Hogan(ex-Confines) as well as Blythe and Winters, focuses on rhythmic juxtaposition and collaboration in attempting to portray a &quot;confrontation amongst 3 adversaries&quot; (the definition of truel). While, tracks like &quot;Mountain&quot; display conversational improv between guitar and drums, as well as elements of late 60's free jazz. The 2 tracks with vocals, &quot;Trainrider&quot; and &quot;Last Rice&quot;, vary sharply from their instrumental counterparts. &quot;Trainrider&quot; being an almost-ballad with heart-felt lyrics and a blaring guitar solo, and &quot;Last Rice&quot; having a whimsical blues-rock feel, with Hehn sing-yelling in Korean.\nDrawing comparisons to The Melvins, Sleep, and Shellac, Man Made Blast combines a number of genres and compositional styles to carve out a unique album in &quot;Warrior Style&quot;. \n\n- smile politely","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb3435cbeadbea83ee81154f0034f773babb74df","amp;dn":"Man+Made+Blast+-+Warrior+Style+-+2010+-+256Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb3435cbeadbea83ee81154f0034f773babb74df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,52,53,203,234,219,234,131,238,129,21,79,0,52,247,115,186,187,116,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
