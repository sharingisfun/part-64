E.Y.E, an armed branch of the\nSecreta Secretorum is attempting a coup against the all-powerful\nFederation, a coalition of several worlds and planets that rule with an\niron fist.\n\nTo complicate matters, E.Y.E itself is plagued with its own internal\nconflicts between the Jian faction and the Culter faction, to which you\nbelong. Your loyalties are torn between Commander Rimanah, your superior\nand the chief of the Secreta who is a separatist with an unstoppable\nambition, and the &quot;Mentor&quot; your friend and instructor. The &quot;Mentor&quot; tries\nat all costs to unite the two rival factions. In doing so, you are thrust\ninto the middle of a fratricidal war frought with political conspiracies\nand quests for power in which different groups and megacorporations are\nimplicated.\n\nThese troubles set the stage for an attack by an unknown force bent on\ndestroying humankind.\n   \nFeatures:\n\nMultiplayer co-op modes directly influence solo play, and vice-versa. The\nlimits of solo and multiplayer games are finally left behind.\n   \nPsychological and mental trauma management.\n    \n25 weapons, different shooting modes, dynamic precision, drilling shots,\niron sighting, extended zoom.\n   \nComplete hacking system with game play impact\n   \n9 devastatingly subtle PSI powers.\n   \nMore than 20 NPC with non-scripted, fully reactive and efficient AI,\nendowed with a sense of initiative. Bloody close combat with technical\ndetail. Incredible physical movement realism thanks to Source Engine\nphysics.\n   \nExcellent replayability - primary and secondary missions, dynamic\nenvironments, non-linear level progression, and random NPC spawn, type\nand appearance. Death doesn't penalize players: no need to restart the\ncurrent mission.\n   \nOpen-level gameplay for hours of fun without reloading. \n\n-Multiplayer Was Tested And Worked With Hamachi-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51fcd8e89e47cc63563e835d4258a18733df07f4","amp;dn":"E.Y.E.Divine.Cybermancy-KaOs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51fcd8e89e47cc63563e835d4258a18733df07f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,252,216,232,158,71,204,99,86,62,131,93,66,88,161,135,51,223,7,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
