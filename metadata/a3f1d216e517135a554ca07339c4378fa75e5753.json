Meta tags that also play important role can be autogenerated (where supported) or entered manually (for all Joomla! URLs). JoomSEF fully supports UTF-8 and will work with non-latin URLs also. In cooperation with JoomFish, it supports URL translations and localization at multilingual sites.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3f1d216e517135a554ca07339c4378fa75e5753","amp;dn":"Artio+Joomsef+4.0.8+Full%2C+Joomla+1.6+and+1.7+SEF+component","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3f1d216e517135a554ca07339c4378fa75e5753","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,241,210,22,229,23,19,90,85,76,160,115,57,196,55,143,167,94,87,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
