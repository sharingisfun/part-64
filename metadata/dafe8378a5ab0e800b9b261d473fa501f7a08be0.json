Not only is there advice on how to recognise birds visually, but also how to identify them from their calls and songs, and for this series, wildlife sound recordist Chris Watson has recorded the songs and calls of birds both here and elsewhere in the UK.\n\nThis entertaining and practical series will help you distinguish blackcaps from garden warblers, and chiff chaffs from willow warblers. It should appeal not only to complete bird-watching novices but also to those who are eager to learn more about our woodland visitors. \n\nAccompanying this series, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also an interactive webpage Brett WestwoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Guide to British Birdsong &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/birdsong.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/birdsong.shtml&lt;/a&gt; where you can listen to the calls and songs of individual birds.\n\n1/5 Classic Woodland Birds\n\nBrett is joined by keen bird watcher Stephen Moss in the Forest of Dean.
