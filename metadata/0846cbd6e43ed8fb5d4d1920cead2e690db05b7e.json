Neverland is a realm of white jungles and legendary mysteries of \neternal youth, where unknown friends and enemies snatched from time welcome \nthe new travelers with both excitement and trepidation. These groups include\na band of 18th century pirates led by the power-mad Elizabeth Bonny, and the \nNative American Kaw tribe led by a Holy Man, which has protected the secret \nof the tree spirits from Bonny and her gang for ages, and that has meant war. \nBut as the fight to save this strange and beautiful world becomes vital, Hook, \nPeter, and the ragamuffin lost boys consider that growing old somewhere in \ntime could be less important than growing up, right here in their new home \ncalled Neverland.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0846cbd6e43ed8fb5d4d1920cead2e690db05b7e","amp;dn":"Neverland+2011+Part+Two+XviD%5Bettv%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0846cbd6e43ed8fb5d4d1920cead2e690db05b7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,70,203,214,228,62,216,251,93,77,25,32,206,173,46,105,13,176,91,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
