I think this is hands down the best out there.  Just discovered it one night with a friend of mine, and it is spectacular.\n\nAlthough the tone of the songs on the album seem to match the mood of the movie throughout, there are a bunch of instances that really exhibit the sync.  Here is a list of many of them:\n\n\nShine On You Crazy Diamond I - V\n\nMultiple scene transitions sync with music.\nSong slowly fades in as the sun rises over the moon and Earth.\nMovie title syncs to synthesizer.\nGilmour's guitar emphasizes landscape shots.\nGuitar riffs as the leopard jumps down and attacks the monkey.\nMonkey's eyes match the high hat right before the lyrics begin.\n&quot;Remember when you were young.&quot;  When man had not evolved.\n&quot;You shone like the sun.&quot;  Scene transition to daylight.\n&quot;You reached for the secret too soon.&quot;  Monkeys reach out and touch the monolith.\n&quot;You cried for the moon.&quot;  Monolith is aligned with the moon above.\nMany more lyrical syncs.\n\n\nWelcome to the Machine\n\nTransition from SOYCD, dark hum as monkey realizes knowledge of tool use.\nMechanical &quot;thump&quot; as the monkey crunches the pig skull with the bone.\n&quot;Welcome to the machine.&quot;  Eating meat now, using tools; becoming human.  &quot;Dawn of Man&quot;.\nBone is thrown into the air to the synth whistle.\nTransition to space age:\n&quot;Welcome to the machine.&quot;  Space station appears to reverb sound effect.\n&quot;Dreamed of a big star.&quot;  Space travel.\nEnd of song:\nThump 1 - Space station enters from upper right.\nSynth hums while station floats through frame.\nThump 2 - Shuttle appears in lower right.\nPeople laugh while riding the shuttle.\n\n\nHave a Cigar\n\nKick ass transition to landing bay.\nRight as guitar starts, the shuttle appears from the bottom right of the bay.\n&quot;Come in here dear boy...&quot;  Shuttle is flying into space station.\n&quot;You're gonna go far.  You're gonna fly high.&quot; \n\nOh by the way, which one's pink?*  Sick.\n\n&quot;Everybody else is just green.&quot;  Woman on the screen is dressed in green.\n\n\n\nWish You Were Here\n\nSong begins when Dr. Heywood R FLOYD gets of the phone with his daughter.\nGreat song, not much of a sync except as time filler.\n\n\nShine On You Crazy Diamond VI - IX\n\nTransition - Guitar riff syncs to woman walking around and upside-down in hallway.\nAgain, music mood syncs with space-scapes and shuttle travel.\nAs shuttle lowers into dock, music goes down the scale with it.\n&quot;And I'll be joining you there.&quot;  As shuttle lands.\n&quot;Come on you miner for truth and delusion.&quot;  Monolith was dug up on the moon.\nFunky organ and guitar fill time during meeting.\nSpacey synth follows shuttle flight.\nSong ends as shuttle flies away.\n\n\nJupiter and Beyond the Infinite &amp; Echoes\n\nNo explanation needed.  If you don't know already...enjoy.\n\n\nI am constantly amazed every time I watch this sync, and I have a little pride knowing that one night we put this together without any previous knowledge of it.  I haven't seen this anywhere else, which really surprises me since it seems to sync up perfectly.  You can restart the cd to sync with the rest of the movie, but the effect is lost due to the large amount of dialogue. \n\nPlease feel free to comment on the video.  I am interested in what other people think of this because, except for a close group of my friends and family, I haven't met anyone who has ever seen this.  It's just my opinion, but I'll take this over The Wizard of Oz/DSTOM sync any day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a307b1437bc88b5cb8e4bab89a167549ac6458be","amp;dn":"2001+-+A+Floyd+Odyssey.m2ts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a307b1437bc88b5cb8e4bab89a167549ac6458be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,7,177,67,123,200,139,92,184,228,186,184,154,22,117,73,172,100,88,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
