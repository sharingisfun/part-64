Revolts have taken place because of economic hard times, the denial of civil rights, racism, sexism, and classism. Studying the reasons for and results of these uprisings provides a window into the life of the American body politicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and what moves the American people to action.\n\nRevolts, Protests, Demonstrations, and Rebellions in American History: An Encyclopedia details the history of popular actions from the colonial era to the 20th century. Each event in the three-volume encyclopedia is covered by an overview entry that details who was involved, why the revolt took place, what happened, and what the aftereffects were. Shorter subentries provide further detail on the important people, places, events, and ideas that were a part of the action. By presenting both the broad themes and the specifics, the encyclopedia enables readers to gain a general knowledge of the event or drill down to acquire a greater understanding.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 1274 pages\n# Publisher: ABC-CLIO (December 17, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1598842218\n# ISBN-13: 978-1598842210","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25fc1d2c0e58b84b3f6e77858735c1d6ad598f73","amp;dn":"Revolts%2C+Protests%2C+Demonstrations%2C+and+Rebellions+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25fc1d2c0e58b84b3f6e77858735c1d6ad598f73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,252,29,44,14,88,184,75,63,110,119,133,135,53,193,214,173,89,143,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
