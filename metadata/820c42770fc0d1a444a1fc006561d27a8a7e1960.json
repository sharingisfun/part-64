The film was released on February 1, 2012 in the United Kingdom and Ireland and was released in the United States and India on February 3, 2012. It received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n* Plotv :\n\nThe film is presented as found footage mostly from a personal video camera owned by Andrew (Dane DeHaan); a high school teenager who starts videotaping his day to day life. At home, he is bullied by an abusive and alcoholic father, who is bitter about a firefighting injury that forced him to retire and the fact that Andrew's mother is dying from cancer. At school, Andrew is unpopular and friendless, frequently bullied by fellow classmates. One night, Andrew and his cousin, Matt (Alex Russell) attend a local rave located in a converted farm barn. Outside, Andrew is approached by Steve (Michael B. Jordan), who tells him that he and Matt have found something strange and they want him to come film it, leading Andrew to the mysterious hole in the ground which emits a loud and strange sound. The three of them proceed into the hole where they find a large, glowing object, which causes Andrew's camera to begin to distort. Upon touching the object the teenagers noses begin to bleed rapidly and they experience great pain. The object then turns red and the camera blacks out.\n\nSeveral weeks later, Andrew, Matt, and Steve have developed telekinetic powers from their experience in the hole, demonstrating the ability to move, throw, and stop objects with their minds, with overuse of their powers causing nose bleeds and mental trauma. They then decide to visit the hole once again but discover that it has sunk in and the area has been sealed off by the SheriffÃƒÅ Ã‚Â»s department. Matt theorizes that their powers function like a muscle, becoming stronger each time they use them, but it seems that Andrew's abilities are accelerating at a faster rate than both Matt and Steve. Initially the boys use their powers to play practical jokes on people, and the three boys develop a close friendship, but Matt later insists they set rules regarding their new found powers after Andrew used his powers to send an impatient motorist off a road into a river.\n\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE FILES 2012 *","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:820c42770fc0d1a444a1fc006561d27a8a7e1960","amp;dn":"CHRONICLE+XVID+cam+GLOBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"820c42770fc0d1a444a1fc006561d27a8a7e1960","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,12,66,119,15,192,209,164,68,161,252,0,101,97,210,122,138,126,25,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
