While the Spectacle was on their U.S. tour in 2004 they decided to record another album for Crimethinc. and Smart Patrol. They wanted the album to be about failure. When they came back to BodÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸ they started writing songs and recording and about a year later on the 5th of September 2005 while on tour in Europe Crimethinc. released the CD-version. Smart Patrol put out the I, Fail 2xLP the 4th of May 2006 and we were really happy with the result. I, Fail is a challenging record, full of variations; samples, acoustic guitars, electronic parts and african drums. In every direction possible it broadens the definition of what punk is today. We included a huge lyric-sheet/poster with photos from past tours and the album jacket have details in UV-laquer. All copies came shrink wraped.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.smartpatrol.no/releases/spud006&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.smartpatrol.no/releases/spud006&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.crimethinc.com/x/audio.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.crimethinc.com/x/audio.html&lt;/a&gt;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:604ba27f4deae3f6c777952d2fe7d75784ce9573","amp;dn":"The+Spectacle+-+I+Fail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"604ba27f4deae3f6c777952d2fe7d75784ce9573","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,75,162,127,77,234,227,246,199,119,149,45,47,231,215,87,132,206,149,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
