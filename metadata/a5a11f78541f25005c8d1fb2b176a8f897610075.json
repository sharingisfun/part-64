Alex talks with Robert Jeppostol, an eyewitness and survivor of the Oslo bombing. \n\nHe also talks about the attack with author, publisher, and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under three different administrations, Steve Pieczenik. Dr. Pieczenik told Alex Jones earlier this year that a top general had revealed to him that 9/11 was an inside job and he would testify to that fact. \n\nAlex also talks with author Webster Tarpley about suspicious incidents that expose the attack as a false flag event. \n\nToday's broadcast went approximately 45 minutes into a 4th hour overDrive.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
