Textured guitar work and layered percussion color Ian Love's raspy squeal for a space rock wave, particularly on tracks like &quot;Stars&quot; and &quot;Crash.&quot; Hints of House of Love and Chapterhouse coast along to the charming pop ballad &quot;Your Eyes,&quot; while &quot;Our Love Is Real&quot; languishes in lover-like passion. Such an urgency carries the entire album as well, and the bandmembers aren't overindulgent in their craft. They're sincere in creating a lush soundscape that's distinctly inventive regardless of those early dream pop threads echoing throughout. Cardia, which was self-recorded and self-produced by the band, is an impressive introduction to four guys who had previously experienced individual success on a mainstream level. Cardia follows its own formula and makes something beautiful. ~ MacKenzie Wilson, Rovi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5fc7ca589257c4df304994a59413dcdace7df49","amp;dn":"Cardia+-+Cardia+%5B2003%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5fc7ca589257c4df304994a59413dcdace7df49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,252,124,165,137,37,124,77,243,4,153,74,89,65,61,205,172,231,223,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
