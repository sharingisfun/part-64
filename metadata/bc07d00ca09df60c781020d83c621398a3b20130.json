The particles may be chemically reacting or be in contact with solid surfaces, and the electrons may show quantum behaviour. These interesting properties have led to many applications of complex plasmas in technology, medicine and science.\n\nYet complex plasmas are extremely complicated, both experimentally and theoretically, and require a variety of new approaches which go beyond standard plasma physics courses. This book fills this gap presenting an introduction to theory, experiment and computer simulation in this field. Based on tutorial lectures at a very successful recent Summer Institute, the presentation is ideally suited for graduate students, plasma physicists and experienced undergraduates.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 447 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (August 4, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 3642105912\n    * ISBN-13: 978-3642105913","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc07d00ca09df60c781020d83c621398a3b20130","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Complex+Plasmas%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc07d00ca09df60c781020d83c621398a3b20130","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,7,208,12,160,157,246,12,120,16,32,216,60,98,19,152,163,178,1,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
