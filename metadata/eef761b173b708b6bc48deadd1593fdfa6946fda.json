It is a very live, frank, surprising portrait of the life of a common man in Lisbon during the 50's and 60's.\nIt develops itself in an interview with the protagonist intersected by scenes of his present (at the date of the movie) and past life. He talks about himself in the patois of the uneducated lisboners trying to explain how the box business was at the time an industry of exploitation of poor illiterate people who had nothing else to sell than his physical brute force. However he talks with self-satisfaction and belief in his own abilities to face life\ndespite the fact that he is already practically finished as boxer and doesn't have any aptitude to do anything else.\n\nIt was very much influenced by the Italian Neo-realism, but it's cinematically much more stylish than most of those features. A major contribution for the astounding art quality of the film is the omnipresence of Augusto Cabrita, probably the best portuguese cameraman/photographer of the 50's, 60's and 70's. With Cabrita's sensibility and technique, combined with Lopes' imagination and accuracy, we get fabulous frames, that most certainly have influenced many other directors.\nwatch closely the opening credits, as well as the fantastic sequence at the jazzclub (you can even see the major expert Villas Boas descending the stairs!) and the fabulous ending shots with Belarmino washing his face at Lisbon downtown, dived in humidity and smooth rain.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Belarmino.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,048,915,968 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:12:18\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 672x480 (AR: 1.400)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1732 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.215 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057880/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057880/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPortuguese audio; English, French and Portuguese subpack\n\nMy rip of the Portuguese DVD\n\nFernando Lopes - Belarmino (1964)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eef761b173b708b6bc48deadd1593fdfa6946fda","amp;dn":"Fernando+Lopes+-+Belarmino+%281964%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eef761b173b708b6bc48deadd1593fdfa6946fda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,247,97,177,115,183,8,182,188,72,222,173,209,89,63,223,166,148,111,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
