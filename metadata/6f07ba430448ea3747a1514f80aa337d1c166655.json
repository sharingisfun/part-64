But in reality, trying to mother Rebecca (Rowan Blanchard) and Cecil (Mason Cook), who clearly don't want her around, is her toughest challenge yet. Also, her husband, Wilbur (Joel McHale), wouldn't know a spy if he lived with one which is exactly the case - Marissa's a retired secret agent. Marissa's world is turned upside down when the maniacal Timekeeper (Jeremy Piven) threatens to take over the planet and she's called back into action by the head of OSS, home of the greatest spies and where the now-defunct Spy Kids division was created. With Armageddon quickly approaching, Rebecca and Cecil are thrust into action when they learn their boring stepmom was once a top agent and now the world's most competitive ten year olds are forced to put their bickering aside and rely on their wits. With a little help from a couple of very familiar Spy Kids, Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara), and some mind-blowing gadgets, they just may be able to save the world and possibly bring their family together while they're at it.\n\nGenre: Action and Adventure, Family\n\nDirector: Robert Rodriguez\n\nCast: Jessica Alba, Joel McHale, Jeremy Piven, Ricky Gervais, Alexa Vega, Daryl Sabara, Rowan Blanchard, Mason Cook, Danny Trejo, Antonio Banderas\n\nWriters: Robert Rodriguez\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nVideo: Xvid 1920x1080 23.98fps\n\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 320kbps\n___________________________________________________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f07ba430448ea3747a1514f80aa337d1c166655","amp;dn":"Spy+Kids%3A+All+The+Time+In+The+World.+Movie+Featurette+%5BHD%5D+%282011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f07ba430448ea3747a1514f80aa337d1c166655","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,7,186,67,4,72,234,55,71,161,81,79,128,170,51,125,28,22,102,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
