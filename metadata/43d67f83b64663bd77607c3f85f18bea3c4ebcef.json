The frequent graphs, charts, and tables have been updated or replaced, and 110 new items included. Initially, this set may be used most by those researching the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. While publication was prior to this event, students will find plenty here for their reports. Along with background on how oil is formed, the authors provide in-depth information on the oil industry and past spills, and the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOil and natural gas drilling and wellsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ article describes various methods of extraction and associated dangers, including blowouts. There's plenty more here, however, as the set also covers other resources and events, ideas, technology, people and groups, legislation, and countries. The sometimes complex but always clearly written pieces range in length from approximately 500 to 3000 words and are subdivided using headings such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCategory,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhere Found,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPrimary Uses,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHistory.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Many of the relatively few black-and-white photographs are token. However, this resource will find uses in ready-reference and for reports on subjects as diverse as chemistry and social studies. Adding to its value is complementary access to a corresponding e-book, available until 12/31/11.Henrietta Thornton-Verma, School Library Journal\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â© Copyright 2010.

All articles have been revised; in addition, about 140 articles have been added. In language accessible to the student and layperson, the work encompasses mineral, plant, and animal resources as well as entries on topics such as organizations, agencies, top resource countries, conservation, ecology, geological processes and formations, and political issues. Written primarily by a team of about 200 scholars from colleges and universities throughout the U.S., the 575 signed, alphabetically arranged essays range in length from about 500 words to 3,000 words (6 pages). Essays longer than 1,000 words long conclude with suggestions for further reading that may include books and articles as well as Web sites (hyperlinked in the online version). Each article is subdivided by informational subheadings to facilitate browsing; the online version includes hyperlinks to glossary terms. Summary information is provided at the beginning of each article; cross-references occur at the end. Sample entries include American Petroleum Institute; Argentina; Boron; Capitalism and resource exploitation; Carver, George Washington; Civilian Conservation Corps; Deep ecology; Kyoto Protocol; Marine vents; Oil spills; Propane; Reforestation; and Water supply systems. The content is augmented by 235 charts, tables, and graphs as well as about 200 photographs. Illustrations and photographs in the print version are in black and white; the online version is enhanced by the use of some color photographs. Appendixes include tables of natural resources and producers by geographic area, a glossary, a thematically arranged bibliography, and an annotated listing of Web sites. A category index and an extensive subject index provide access. Notable for authoritative content written at a level accessible to the student and layperson, the Encyclopedia of Global Resources is highly recommended for high-school, college, and public libraries. Access to the online version is available free to purchasers of the print set. --Nancy Cannon\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 1504 pages\n    * Publisher: Salem Pr Inc; 2nd edition (April 16, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1587656442\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1587656446","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43d67f83b64663bd77607c3f85f18bea3c4ebcef","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Global+Resources+%284+Vols%29%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43d67f83b64663bd77607c3f85f18bea3c4ebcef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,214,127,131,182,70,99,189,119,96,124,63,133,241,139,234,60,78,188,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
