This comes in handy if you want to share your menu design\nwith others.\n\n- Add music, image, and video to your menu\nAdd background music, favorite photos, and action videos to\nmake your menus come alive.\n\n- True drag and drop functionality\nAdjust the playing order of titles or chapters in the DVD\nsimply by dragging and dropping.

You may also use it to select and extract\nany video title or chapters to a new MPEG file.\n\n- MPEG multiplexer, de-multiplexer\nUse MPEG Multiplexer to combine video and audio data into one\nMPEG file, and use MPEG DeMultiplexer to separate an MPEG file\ninto video and audio data. They can be invaluable for solving\nyour audio-video synchronization problems.\n\n- MPEG MBS Scan\nThe MBS Scanner is most useful for solving MPEG file problems\ncreated by those DVD recorders that contain one of the three\nchanges: time base change, video encoder changes, and audio\nencoder changes.\n\n- MPEG GOP Fixer\nThe MPEG GOP Fixer is a good helper for checking and correcting\nGOP time code errors, video and audio time errors, and DVD GOP\nsize violations.\n\n- MPEG Format Converter\nUse this tool when you need to convert one MPEG-2 format into\nanother MPEG-2 format. It will only change the MPEG-2 Systems\nformat with various packet formations of compressed video and\naudio data. It will not alter the compressed video and audio\ndata.\n\n- Editor Project Package\nThis tool is a great time saver when you need to transfer a\ncomplete editing project from one computer to another,\nespecially when the contents of the project are stored on many\ndifferent file locations.\n\nCONVERTING\n\n- Convert your movies for your iPod and PSP\nYou can rip your DVD library or TV shows into MP4 format for\nyour portable video player, including iPod and PSP.\n\n- Convert your movies to MP4 and H.264\nYou can rip your DVD library or TV shows to MP4 file format.\nYou can select XVid format or H.264 format for video and MPEG-4\nAAC for audio.\n\n- Convert your movies to AVI\nYou can also rip your DVD library or TV shows to AVI file\nformat.\n\n- MP4 Batch Export\nSince an MPEG-4 export job also involves a time consuming MPEG\nencoding process, the MP4 Batch Export is an indispensable tool\nfor managing a large number of export jobs.\n\n- Convert your DV into MPEG-2 and DVD\nOf course, our editor is most useful for adding home movies\nfrom your digital camcorder to your own DVD library.\n\nINSTALL INFO\n\nRun setup and follow instructions.\n\nRegister with this License Key: MVW-DVD5-BRZRZZJZJRFBRN\n\nGREETINGS\n\ngreets fly out to all groups which actively and courageously\nwork on building better release conditions and\nthus keep the scene up.\n\nspecial greets to our friends in:\n\nabsokt - acme - air - digerati - explosion - f4cg\norion - pdx - shock - ssg - tbe - tmg - unleashed - zwt\n\nCONTACT\n\nWe are a closed group, if we need you then we will contact you!\n\nSoftware worth using is worth buying.. keep this in mind!\n\nnfo updated on\n2009.07.19\n\nINFOFILE DRAWN BY\nH7/ACCESSiON\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b510c73fd78717587ed32308c4acaae6ae4fdc2","amp;dn":"Womble.MPEG.Video.Wizard.DVD.v5.0.1.103.Multilanguage.WinALL.Reg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b510c73fd78717587ed32308c4acaae6ae4fdc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,81,12,115,253,120,113,117,135,237,50,48,140,74,202,174,106,228,253,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
