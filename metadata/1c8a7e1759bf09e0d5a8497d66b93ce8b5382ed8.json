The story revolves around a legendary Warrior Priest from the last Vampire War who now lives in obscurity among the other downtrodden human inhabitants in walled-in dystopian cities ruled by the Church. When his niece is abducted by a murderous pack of vampires, Priest breaks his sacred vows to venture out on a quest to find her before they turn her into one of them. He is joined on his crusade by his niece's boyfriend, a trigger-fingered young wasteland sheriff, and a former Warrior Priestess who possesses otherworldly fighting skills.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c8a7e1759bf09e0d5a8497d66b93ce8b5382ed8","amp;dn":"PRIEST+2011+540p+BluRay+QEBS5+AAC20+ANDROID+IPAD+MP4-FASM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c8a7e1759bf09e0d5a8497d66b93ce8b5382ed8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,138,126,23,89,191,9,224,213,168,73,125,102,185,60,232,181,56,46,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
