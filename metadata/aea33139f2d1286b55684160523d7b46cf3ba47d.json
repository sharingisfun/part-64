Thus, people all over the world continue a long tradition of reclaiming this basic human right by squatting. Shelter: a Squatumentary is a documentary film that explores the squatting movement in the East Bay from 2004 to 2007. We follow three examples of the struggle for housing in an unaffordable marketplace such as the San Francisco Bay Area. Hellarity House, Banana House, and Power Machine are stories of squatters who have found one tentative solution to the ongoing housing crisis.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.killnormal.com/shelter/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.killnormal.com/shelter/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aea33139f2d1286b55684160523d7b46cf3ba47d","amp;dn":"Shelter+A+Squatumentary+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aea33139f2d1286b55684160523d7b46cf3ba47d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,163,49,57,242,209,40,107,85,104,65,96,82,61,123,70,207,59,164,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
