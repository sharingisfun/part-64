But for some insane reason, I decided to prove I'm not as good as I once was, but I'm as good once, as I ever was.\n\nSince Nobody ever bothers to leave a comment after downloading one of my Rips, I'm Not bothering to leave a description.\n\nDownload This One if You want to remember what a Real 1-CD Rip looks like, or download a different copy. Makes Me no difference. I'm in Too Much Extreme Pain to give a Crap.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c1ad43eb120fc4d52fce85fd1768a406928ca0f","amp;dn":"Tucker.and%2CDale.vs.Evil.%5B2010%5D.1-CD.BATRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c1ad43eb120fc4d52fce85fd1768a406928ca0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,26,212,62,177,32,252,77,82,252,232,95,209,118,138,64,105,40,202,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
