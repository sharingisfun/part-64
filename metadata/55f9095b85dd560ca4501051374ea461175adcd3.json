King , and Freddie King. This was all recorded live in New York City, at Murray's Street Grill.\n\nThis set is jam packed with so many talented musicians and done somewhat like a jam session recorded live. There are several featured artists on this CD, but Vince Converse seems to be at the head of the pack on this session.  Other artists are Jon Paris on everything: guitar, harmonica, and lead vocals. Clas Ynstrom, &quot;The Jimi Hendrix of Netherlands,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ also throws down top notch work. \n\n\nSorry, but I don't have the DVD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55f9095b85dd560ca4501051374ea461175adcd3","amp;dn":"%28Blues+-+VA%29+Walking+With+The+Kings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55f9095b85dd560ca4501051374ea461175adcd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,249,9,91,133,221,86,12,164,80,16,81,55,78,164,97,23,90,220,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
