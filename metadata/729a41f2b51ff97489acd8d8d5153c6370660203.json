Having said that, I felt it was time that this documentary--still unavailable on DVD--got into a few more peoples collections besides my own.\n\nThis is an outstanding documentary covering the history of Genesis. From their formation when they were barely out of school, through to the stunning artistic but disappointing commercial successes of the Peter Gabriel years, to the uncertainty of allowing drummer and backing vocalist Phil Collins take Gabriel's place, to the unprecedented commercial success of their 80's work, everything from 1968 up until 1990 (when this was released) is covered in detail. \n\nPart of why I feel this video is such a treasure is because all of the members are interviewed so extensively here--including Gabriel, former guitarist Steve Hackett, and even original lead guitarist Anthony Phillips. My only real complaint is that all of the musical footage is in snippets--there are no complete performances here. Still, there's plenty of interest musically, and anyone interested in how the band came to be and how they worked will find this to be a fascinating watch.\n\nI have transferred this from my VHS copy, since as previously mentioned this remains unissued on DVD. To share with maximum quality, I'm uploading my uncompressed, unedited, un-anythinged MPEG of the film. For a VHS rip, I think it looks and sounds great. I have also included a hi-res scan of the VHS cover artwork, which I've reformatted to fit a DVD sleeve. So, if you care to burn this little gem and make a cover, you're all set. I hope everyone enjoys this as much as I do!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:729a41f2b51ff97489acd8d8d5153c6370660203","amp;dn":"Genesis%3A+A+History+%281990+Documentary%29+%2A%2A%2ANOT+on+DVD%2A%2A%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"729a41f2b51ff97489acd8d8d5153c6370660203","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,154,65,242,181,31,249,116,137,172,216,216,213,21,60,99,112,102,2,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
