Out of the tragedy, a savior emerges: GeneCo, a biotech company that offers organ transplants, for a price. Those who miss their payments are scheduled for repossession and hunted by villainous Repo Men. In a world where surgery addicts are hooked on painkilling drugs and murder is sanctioned by law, a sheltered young girl searches for the cure to her own rare disease as well as information about her family's mysterious history. After being sucked into the haunting world of GeneCo, she is unable to turn back, as all of her questions will be answered at the wildly anticipated spectacular event: The Genetic Opera.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49c95ae285f369ae672a574a727854e028bc3f30","amp;dn":"Repo+The+Genetic+Opera+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49c95ae285f369ae672a574a727854e028bc3f30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,201,90,226,133,243,105,174,103,42,87,74,114,120,84,224,40,188,63,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
