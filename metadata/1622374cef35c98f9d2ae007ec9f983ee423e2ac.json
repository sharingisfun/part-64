It involves the adventures of three agents from outer space who are sent to Earth to determine whether the planet, a potential threat to the universe, should be destroyed. The instrument of destruction is a device resembling a large black ball with two antennae that is variously called an anti-proton bomb, a solar bomb, and a neutron bomb. Although the three agents (Captain Bokko, Nokko, and Pukko) are originally humanoid in appearance, upon arrival on Earth they take on the appearances of a rabbit (Bokko), a horse (Nokko), and a duck (Pukko) that they had captured as examples of Earth life forms. While on Earth they travel in a tire-shaped vehicle capable of enormous speeds called the Big Wheel, which can travel on both land and water (and, with modifications, through the air).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1622374cef35c98f9d2ae007ec9f983ee423e2ac","amp;dn":"Wonder+3+disk+2+of+10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1622374cef35c98f9d2ae007ec9f983ee423e2ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,34,55,76,239,53,201,143,157,42,224,7,236,159,152,62,228,35,226,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
