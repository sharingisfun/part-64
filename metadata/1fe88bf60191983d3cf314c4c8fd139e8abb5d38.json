Willie Trice and his brother Richard became close friends with Blind Boy Fuller and Fuller took them up to New York where they cut six sides together (two unissued) for Decca in 1937. Richard Trice recorded after the war for Savoy in 1946 as Little Boy Fuller as well as a couple of sides in 1948 and 1952/53. Richard Trice was later recorded by Pete Lowry but those recordings remain unreleased. It wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t until the 1970ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s that Willie Trice recorded again. 'Blue And RagÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d' , his solo album, was released on LowryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Trix label in 1973.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fe88bf60191983d3cf314c4c8fd139e8abb5d38","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Willie+Trice+-+Blue+%26+Rag%5C%27d","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fe88bf60191983d3cf314c4c8fd139e8abb5d38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,232,139,246,1,145,152,61,60,243,20,196,200,253,19,158,138,187,93,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
