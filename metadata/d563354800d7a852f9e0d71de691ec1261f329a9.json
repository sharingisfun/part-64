The 7-song EP is a reimagining of some of the Red Hot Chili PeppersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ most epic tracks as a backdrop for MCs A-Plus, Del and Knobody. The brainchild of Compound 7 member AAGEE (who suggested an EP release with production based entirely off the Chili Peppers), PEPPER SPRAY is a specialty project, according to A-Plus. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe whole purpose is a Hip Hop tribute to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, inspired by their music and dedicated to their work. The cover is going to be a spin-off of one of their most popular covers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a theme all throughout,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nhe explains. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe songs are all topic-oriented, sonically as well as lyrically. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a conceptual EP, certainly. I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want people to look at this like itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s MY new album, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s something I worked on but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s obviously in a different lane,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ emphasizes A-Plus. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m stepping outside of my paradigm to do something new, different and artistic.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n  \nStandout cuts on Pepper Spray include Californication, which features Del. A-Plus explains the significance of Californication ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe way the song is set up, you have to hear it, its two verses then the beat changes, then the verses again, like a refrain. I instantly thought of Del after we finalized the beat. The subculture of California is snaky but its home, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what the Chili PeppersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ song is about so I just rapped about what California is for me in the same way - the positive and negative.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n  \nMemories and experiences of tours &amp; being on the road are a recurring theme of the Red Hot Chili PeppersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ music as well as on Pepper Spray. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRoad TrippinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is a song about leaving to go on the road, and what it entails. Just being out from an artistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s perspective and how itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a very hard but amazing job,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ A-Plus reasons. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBy the Way is another song about being on the road, but more of a specific story, of our tour bus getting pulled over, smelling like weed, me getting arrested, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a story ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re both tour-story oriented.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n  \nPepper Spray, in drawing from one of the greatest alt-rock bands of this century and turning their sound into a Hip Hop format will undoubtedly draw new fans toward both genres of music and beyond. One thing is sure; Compound 7ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Pepper Spray is like nothing youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve heard before.\ncreditsreleased 05 July 2011 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d563354800d7a852f9e0d71de691ec1261f329a9","amp;dn":"A-Plus+-+Pepper+Spray+%282011%29+%2A320kbs%2A+Hip-Hop+inspired+by+the+Ch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d563354800d7a852f9e0d71de691ec1261f329a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,99,53,72,0,215,168,82,249,224,215,29,230,145,236,18,97,243,41,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
