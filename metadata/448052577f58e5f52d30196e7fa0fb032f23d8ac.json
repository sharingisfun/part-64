Yet within months of pledging himself to the great charter, the King reneged on his word and assembled a mercenary army on the south coast of England with the intention of bringing the barons and the country back under his tyrannical rule. Barring his way stood the mighty Rochester castle, a place that would become the symbol of the rebelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s momentous struggle for justice and freedom.\n\n\n\n\nGenre: Action | Adventure\nIMDB rating: 6.9/10\nDirected by: Jonathan English\nStarring: Paul Giamatti, Jason Flemyng and Brian Cox\n\nRelease Name: Ironclad.2011.BDRip.XviD-AiHD\nSize: 1.37\nVideo: XviD | 640ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€352 | 1169kbps\nAudio: English | AC-3 | 448 kbps\nRuntime: 120 mins\nSubtitle: English\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:448052577f58e5f52d30196e7fa0fb032f23d8ac","amp;dn":"Ironclad+2011+BDRip+XviD-AiHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"448052577f58e5f52d30196e7fa0fb032f23d8ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,128,82,87,127,88,229,245,45,48,25,110,127,160,251,3,47,35,216,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
