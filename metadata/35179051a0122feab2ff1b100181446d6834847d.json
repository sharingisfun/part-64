He      \n    has had numerous top ten hits in the US &amp; UK, most notably China         \n    Girl, Space Oddity, Under Pressure and more. Told through archive        \n    interviews (originally thought lost) and rare and unseen footage,        \n    this DVD is a worthy addition to any Bowie collection. Items             \n    genuinely unseen and never before appeared on DVD including film from    \n    the ITN archive. Includes lost and now restored TV interviews from       \n    the past and rare film of the singer talking about his career.           \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
