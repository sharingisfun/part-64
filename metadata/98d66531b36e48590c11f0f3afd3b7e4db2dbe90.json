When a motorcycle accident leaves Dean paralyzed, he abandons his turntables for a wheelchair as his once promising career disappears before his eyes. Forced to live out of his car on skid row, Dean begins his descent into depression when he meets Father Joe Roselli, a passionate young priest. Father Joe introduces Dean to the world of faith-healing, an unlikely way for him to begin his quest to walk again. He soon discovers that he possesses the otherworldly power to heal people, but in an odd twist of fate, he is utterly unable to heal himself. Despite Father JoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s warnings, Dean angrily decides to use his newfound gift for fame and fortune. He joins a rock band led by charismatic front man The Stain with bassist Ariel, and manager Nina Hogue. But his newfound notoriety is unable to cure the hurt that encompasses his life. To find true healing, Dean must ultimately confront his worst demons and come to terms with his own humanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n^ MOViE iNFO______________________________________\nGENRE...........: Comedy | Drama\nDiRECTOR........: Mark Ruffalo\nWRiTER..........: Christopher Thornton\n\n\n\n^ CAST____________________________________________\nMark Ruffalo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Joe\nOrlando Bloom ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ The Stain\nJuliette Lewis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Ariel Lee\nLaura Linney ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Nina Hogue\nJohn Carroll Lynch ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Healer\nNoah Emmerich ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Rene Faubacher\nJames Karen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Father Bill Rohn\nDiana Terranova ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Brittany\nNathan Wetherington ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Bartender\nDov Tiefenbach ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Oogie\nChristopher Thornton ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“DeliciousÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Dean OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Dwyer\nMartin Santander ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Bouncer\nErin Way ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Rianna Tevy\nMarnie Alexenburg ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Paramedic\nNiko Nicotera ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Rasha\nSandra Seacat ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Mrs. Matilda\nTimothy McNeil ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Ryan Webster\nNandini Iyer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Rock Girl\nWillie Macc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Pretty Boy Willie\n\n\n\n\n\n^ GENERAL iNFO____________________________________\nDXVA COMPATiBLE*: Yes\nCONTAiNER.......: .mp4 (MPEG-4)\nFiLE SiZE.......: 2.00 GiB\nDURATiON........: 1h 41mn\nTOTAL BiTRATE...:  2 827 Kbps\nSOURCE..........: 1080p-\nSUBTiTLES.......: English | Romanian\n\n\n* What is DXVA?\n DXVA, or DirectX Video Accelleration, is a system built into Windows operating systems \n since Windows XP that allows programs, if they support it, to offload the decoding of \n certain media codecs to the GPU.
