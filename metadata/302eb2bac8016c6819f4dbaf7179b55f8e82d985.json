How about a 3D zombie shooter game! Welcome to Hell is just that! This game is rather simple once you figure out the controls. Each level you have to kill more and more zombies. You gain various amounts of points depending on where you shot the zombie. The more points you gain you can buy new guns and kill the zombies quicker. The prices on the guns are rather high, so donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t expect to get the bazooka in level eight or nine. If you shot the zombie in the leg it will knock him down and slow its advance on you. The zombies charge at you and slash at you and will kill you if you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t shot them first. There are only three different backgrounds in this game, which is rather disappointing. The same three backgrounds rotate through which can cause the felling of playing the same levels over and over again.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:302eb2bac8016c6819f4dbaf7179b55f8e82d985","amp;dn":"Wel+Hell+3D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"302eb2bac8016c6819f4dbaf7179b55f8e82d985","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,46,178,186,200,1,108,104,25,244,219,175,113,121,181,95,142,130,217,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
