Most people believe that she ran out of fuel and crashed in the sea. But one man is convinced she met a different fate, and he believes he is on the verge of proving it. \nFollow Ric Gillespie and his team as they travel to Nikumaroro, a remote Pacific island 350 miles from Amelia's last known location. That's where he believes Amelia landed her plane, struggled to survive as a castaway and finally died. He has found new clues and compelling evidence during his past expeditions, but no hard proof ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ yet. This time, he and his team are returning with the latest in scanning technology and an ambitious plan. They'll be deploying an advanced submersible to search the island's reef for wreckage from Amelia's plane. On land, they'll look for artifacts that may carry her DNA too. Will Ric, after 22 years of searching, solve the greatest of all aviation mysteries...finding Amelia? \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bea34d72756eb82d883579b7be4b687b22e45bfe","amp;dn":"Finding+Amelia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bea34d72756eb82d883579b7be4b687b22e45bfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,163,77,114,117,110,184,45,136,53,121,183,190,75,104,123,34,228,91,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
