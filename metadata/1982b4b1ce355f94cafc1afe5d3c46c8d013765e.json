It parodies the romanticised, sometimes doom-laden accounts of rural life popular at the time, by writers such as Mary Webb. Gibbons was working for the Evening Standard in 1928 when they decided to serialise Webb's first novel, The Golden Arrow, and had the job of summarising the plot of earlier installments. Other novelists in the tradition parodied by Cold Comfort Farm are D. H. Lawrence, Sheila Kaye-Smith and Thomas Hardy; and going further back, Mary E Mann and the BrontÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â« sisters. The book is set in the near future.\n\nOrphaned, destitute, and unwilling to get a job, 20-year-old Flora Poste looks to her relatives for a place to live. She settles upon the Starkadders, relatives on her mother's side, who live on the isolated Cold Comfort Farm, near the fictional Sussex village of Howling. Greeting her as &quot;Robert Poste's child,&quot; they take her in to repay an unexplained wrong done to her father.\n\nEach member of the extended family has some long-standing emotional problem caused by ignorance, hatred or fear; and the farm is badly run -- supposedly cursed -- and presided over by the unseen and ominous presence of Aunt Ada Doom, who is said to have been driven mad by seeing &quot;something nasty in the woodshed&quot; as a child.\n\nFlora, a level-headed urban woman, applies modern common sense to their problems and intends for them all to adapt to the twentieth century.\n\n\nThe author\n\nStella Dorothea Gibbons (5 January 1902 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 19 December 1989) was an English novelist, journalist, poet, and short-story writer. Her first novel, Cold Comfort Farm, won the Femina Vie Heureuse Prize for 1933. A satire and parody of the pessimistic ruralism of Thomas Hardy, his followers and especially Precious Bane by Mary WebbÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the &quot;loam and lovechild&quot; genre, as some called itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Cold Comfort Farm introduces a self-confident young woman, quite consciously modern, pragmatic, and optimistic, into the grim, fate-bound, and dark rural scene those novelists tended to portray.\n\n\nThe reader\n\nAnna Raymond Massey, CBE (born 11 August, 1937 - 3 July 2011) is an English actress born in Thakeham, West Sussex, England, the daughter of British actress Adrianne Allen and Canadian-born Hollywood actor Raymond Massey.
