One enterprising syndicator purchased the rights for a group of British and European films, originally targeted for the Saturday-matinee crowd. One such film was Black Island, released theatrically in England in 1979. Martin Murphy and Michael Salomon head the cast as a couple of British kids named Michael and Joe. Stranded on a remote island, the boys rather enjoy the adventure -- until they discover that two escaped convicts have also landed on the tiny isle. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi\n\nRunning Time: 60 Minutes\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309368/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309368/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n** Memory Lane Presents **","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1825ccee37b52abd37a88c27b28c86e486d6e34","amp;dn":"Memory+Lane+Presents+Black+Island+1979+%28CFF%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1825ccee37b52abd37a88c27b28c86e486d6e34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,130,92,206,227,123,82,171,211,122,136,194,123,40,200,110,72,109,110,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
