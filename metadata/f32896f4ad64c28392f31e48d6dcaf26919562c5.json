Jin has a more traditional style but donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think of this as a weakness because his skills are amazing. The two contrasting samurai warriors are far from friends, yet their separate paths seem to cross anyways. Mugen is wandering aimlessly through the city when he stumbles upon a teahouse where he meets Jin and Fuu (A ditzy waitress, but donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“t think she doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“t have anything hidden up her sleeves). Fuu convinces them both to come with her in search of a mysterious samurai that smells like sunflowers and their journey begins.
