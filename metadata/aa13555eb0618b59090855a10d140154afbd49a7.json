It was accepted, but after the hoax was revealed, the publisher withdrew its offer.\n\nThe primary purpose of the exercise was to test PublishAmerica's claims to be a &quot;traditional publisher&quot; which would only accept high-quality manuscripts.\n\nThe distinctive flaws of Atlanta Nights include nonidentical chapters written by two different authors from the same segment of outline (13 and 15), a missing chapter (21), two chapters that are word-for-word identical to each other (4 and 17), two different chapters with the same chapter number (12 and 12), and a chapter &quot;written&quot; by a computer program that generated random text based on patterns found in the previous chapters (34). Characters change gender and race; they die and reappear without explanation. Spelling and grammar are nonstandard and the formatting is inconsistent. The initials of characters who were named in the book spelled out the phrase &quot;PublishAmerica is a vanity press.&quot;\n\nUnder Macdonald's direction, the finale revealed that all the previous events of the plot had been a dream, although the book continues for several more chapters.\n\nThe completed manuscript was offered to PublishAmerica by an unrevealed person not usually associated with fiction. The manuscript was accepted for publication on 7 December 2004.\n\nThe hoaxers reviewed the contract with legal counsel, and made the decision not to carry the hoax through to actually publishing the book.\n\nOn 23 January 2005, the hoax was publicly revealed by the authors. On 24 January 2005, PublishAmerica retracted its acceptance, stating that after &quot;further review&quot; the novel failed to meet their standards.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa13555eb0618b59090855a10d140154afbd49a7","amp;dn":"Atlanta+Nights.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa13555eb0618b59090855a10d140154afbd49a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,19,85,94,176,97,139,89,9,8,85,161,13,20,1,84,175,189,73,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
