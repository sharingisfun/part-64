O&amp;O Defrag lets you merge the individual fragments so that files are then positioned consecutively on the hard disk. To accomplish this, O&amp;O Defrag gives you three new methods of defragmentation that combine perfectly with all its standard options. Altogether, they allow you to customize the way files are organized on your computer.Your system will start faster, running programs will be speeded up, and new fragmentation can be avoided!\nFully automatic defragmentation at your fingertips!
