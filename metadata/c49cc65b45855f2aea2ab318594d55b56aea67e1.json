Moom's panel appears, and you then click the desired action.\n\nWhen used via the keyboard, a hot key displays the Moom bezel, and you can then use the arrow and modifier keys to move and resize the windows.\n\nWhat's New:\n\nNew Features:\n\n* New 'Save Window Layout Snapshot' menu item allows quick creation\n  of saved window layouts.\n\nBug Fixes and Improvements:\n\n* Grow and Shrink via keyboard now repeat when you hold the assigned\n  keys down. (Hat tip to Sherman W. for the suggestion.)\n\n* Fixed a bug with the Shrink keyboard command.\n\n* The Settings window will now properly appear on the active Space.\n  (Hat tip to Jacob D. for finding this one.)\n\n* The Arrange Windows Custom Control now always remembers all\n  windows. The 'Ignore obstructed windows' checkbox now applies when\n  you activate a saved layout, so you can choose between affecting those\n  windows and not affecting those windows.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac OS X.6 or later\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c49cc65b45855f2aea2ab318594d55b56aea67e1","amp;dn":"Moom+2.1.1+%2B+SK+Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c49cc65b45855f2aea2ab318594d55b56aea67e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,156,198,91,69,133,95,42,234,42,179,24,89,77,85,181,106,234,103,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
