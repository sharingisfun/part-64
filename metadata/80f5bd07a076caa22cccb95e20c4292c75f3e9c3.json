During that time his identity was kept a closely guarded secret by those with whom he dealt - representatives of the IRA's ruling army council and British intelligence officers from MI6 and MI5. Until now, he's only been referred to as &quot;The Link&quot; or &quot;The Contact&quot;, the secret intermediary whose aim was to bring the two sides together to end the conflict. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1216506/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1216506/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7303048.stm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7303048.stm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80f5bd07a076caa22cccb95e20c4292c75f3e9c3","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Peacemaker+BBC+Documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80f5bd07a076caa22cccb95e20c4292c75f3e9c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,245,189,7,160,118,202,162,44,204,185,94,32,196,41,44,117,243,233,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
