Among other admiring contemporary actors interviewed in this look at Garfield's all-too-brief life and career are Joanne Woodward, Richard Dreyfuss, Lee Grant and Norman Lloyd. Co-stars who recall working with Garfield include Hume Cronyn (The Postman Always Rings Twice, 1946) and Patricia Neal (The Breaking Point, 1950). \n\nThe documentary traces Garfield's rise from a tough childhood on New York's Lower East Side through his vagabond youth and apprenticeship with the renowned Group Theatre to his OscarÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®-nominated breakthrough as a film star in Four Daughters (1938). A forerunner to such tough-yet-sensitive rebels as Marlon Brando and James Dean, Garfield displayed what Lee Grant calls his smoldering, somber, troubled street-guy kind of presence in such hard-hitting films as Humoresque (1946) and Force of Evil (1948). \n\nGarfield died prematurely at age 39 in 1952, a victim of a weak heart and, according to some of the documentary's interviewees, the stress of his unofficial blacklisting during the witch-hunt of the House Un-American Activities Committee.\n\nDirector: David Heeley\nBW &amp; C-60m","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72698db5dbbb2d4849d9d378a937f1f6b6513338","amp;dn":"The+John+Garfield+Story+%28TV%29+%28VHS%29++%5B2003%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72698db5dbbb2d4849d9d378a937f1f6b6513338","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,105,141,181,219,187,45,72,73,217,211,120,169,55,241,246,182,81,51,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
