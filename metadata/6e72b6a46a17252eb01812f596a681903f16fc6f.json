That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n=================================\n\n\nSorry for those of you who like my random thoughts. I've made various excuses, but the real reason I've not been doing much in that area is my bipolar cycle is on the down side. I not only find i t difficult to care or get any fun out of doing that (or anything) when I'm more or less depressed (technical term is anhedonia) but the synapses just aren't firing as crazily (and I use that term precisely) as when i'm on the opposite phase. Much of my creativity and free associating thought style is linked to that.  Of course nearly all of the time I find it difficult to think about only one or two things at a time, which also &quot;helps&quot; my writing style.\n\n\nBut you get COMICS!\n\nbtw about 350gb to go!\n\n=================================\n\nToday's offering:  DC from  My-New\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nScanlation of the same comic(manga) DC printed. This title is notable for having had multiple titles, two of which I list\nMy Darling! Miss Bancho aka Dear School Gang Leader (CMX-substitute \n\nMy Faith in Frankie 01-04 (Vertigo(2004)\n\nDoom Patrol premiered in this title (#80), and the book was renamed Doom Patrol at #86.\nMy Greatest Adventure 01-85 at 86=Doom Patrol 86 (1955-1964)\n\nMy Name is Chaos 01-04 Covers-unscanned\nMy Name is Holocaust 01-05 (Blood Syndicate spin-off (DC-Milestone(1995)\nMysteries in Space-The Best of DC Science Fiction (1980)\nMysteries of Unexplored Worlds 46-48-Son of vulcan (Charlton(1965)\nMysterious Suspense 001-The Question (Charlton(10-1968)\nMysterius the Unfathomable 01-05 (WS(2009)\n\nBlue Beetle appeared in these along with others. Not exactly the same same as the Blue Beetle of later years, but the modern Blue Beetle is a continuation and revision of the same character. Like many Golden age heroes he has been revised more than once.\nMystery Men 01-31 (Fox(1939-1942)\n\nMystery Play, The (Vertigo(1994)\n\nI love the original Mystery in Space! DC had the second best science fiction comics in the &quot;olden times&quot;. EC was number one before the dark times, before the code. I find that the other publishers from the 40-60s I've tried are almost always distinctly inferior. For one thing the stories always seem to end too soon, with a jarring effect. Whether it's the case or not, I get the impression the writer had an extra page or two written and the editors cut them down brutally and clumsily. \n\nMystery in Space v1 001-117 (1951-1981)\nMystery in Space v2  01-08 (2006-2007)\n\nMythology-The DC Comics Art of Alex Ross\nMythos-The Final Tour 01-03 (Vertigo(1996-97)\nName of the Game, The (2001)\nNames of Magic, The 01-05-Books of Magic (Vertigo(2001)\nNathaniel Dusk v1-Lovers Die At Dusk 01-04 (1984)\nNathaniel Dusk v2-Apple Peddlers Die at Noon  01-04 (1985)\nNation of Snitches GN (Piranha Press(1990)\nNational Comics 01-75(i) (Quality(1940-1949)\nNational Comics v2 001-JSA Returns 007 ctc (1999)\nNazz, The 01-04 (1990)\nNeil Gaiman Bookmark (Vertigo(2003).jpg\nNeil Gaiman and Charles Vess' Stardust 01-04 (Vertigo(1997-98)\nNeil Gaiman's Neverwhere 01-09 (Vertigo(2005-2006)\nNeil Young's Greendale HC (2010)\nNeil Young's Greendale TPB 161p ctc (2010(F)\nNemesis-The Imposters 01-04 (2010)\nNemo Classic Comics Library 002-Superman\nNevada 01-06 (Vertigo(1998)\nNevada Card.jpg\n\nThese next two are the early issues of the title that became Adventure. \nNew Comics 01-11 (becomes New Adventure 12) (1935-36)\nNew Adventure Comics 12-31 (becomes Adventure 32) (1937-38)\n\nNew Adventures of Charlie Chan, The 01-06 (1958)\n\nThis is the original Superboy, Clark Kent,  Superman as a teenager, not the semi-clone Conner Kent.
