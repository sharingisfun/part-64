The remix was done by the British dub producer Mad Professor. Mad Professor was contacted by Massive Attack after \\\\\\&quot;Protection\\\\\\&quot; was released to remix a song for a single. After the single was remixed, the band asked Mad Professor to listen to more of the album to explore the possibility of further remixes. The project then became a track by track remix of almost the entire album. Mad Professor heavily edited the original material to form a slow, pulsating mix in which the beat is emphasized, reverb is extensively used and the occasional vocals (many of the tracks are almost entirely instrumental) fade in-and-out in typical dub fashion, making a hypnotic, if slightly repetitive, mix. The result is arguably more textured than the original, but loses any sense of the jazzy feel of \\\\\\&quot;Protection\\\\\\&quot;.\n\n\n\n\nTrack listing :\n\n\\\\\\&quot;Radiation Ruling the Nation\\\\\\&quot; (based on \\\\\\&quot;Protection\\\\\\&quot;) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:35\n\\\\\\&quot;Bumper Ball Dub\\\\\\&quot; (based on \\\\\\&quot;Karmacoma\\\\\\&quot;) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:59\n\\\\\\&quot;Trinity Dub\\\\\\&quot; (based on \\\\\\&quot;Three\\\\\\&quot;) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n\\\\\\&quot;Cool Monsoon\\\\\\&quot; (based on \\\\\\&quot;Weather Storm\\\\\\&quot;) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:10\n\\\\\\&quot;Eternal Feedback\\\\\\&quot; (based on \\\\\\&quot;Sly\\\\\\&quot;) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:26\n\\\\\\&quot;Moving Dub\\\\\\&quot; (based on \\\\\\&quot;Better Things\\\\\\&quot;) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:57\n\\\\\\&quot;I Spy\\\\\\&quot; (based on \\\\\\&quot;Spying Glass\\\\\\&quot;) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:07\n\\\\\\&quot;Backward Sucking\\\\\\&quot; (based on \\\\\\&quot;Heat Miser\\\\\\&quot;) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:17\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c479252ec57f2336724759a268063274b704187","amp;dn":"Massive+Attack.No+protection.1995","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c479252ec57f2336724759a268063274b704187","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,71,146,82,236,87,242,51,103,36,117,154,38,128,99,39,75,112,65,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
