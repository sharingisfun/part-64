I set it 240. I didn't go lower.\n 2.4 set audio: mp3, audio bitrate 56kbs, sample rate 22050Hz. But lately I've increased to 64kbs and 44100hz.\n\n3. Hit the button\nYou should get videos somewhere around 60-90 mb.\n\n4. create a torrent, then upload to tpb\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b77fcc22898073b57797bcf43fcb4580b153069","amp;dn":"TTC+-+The+Cathedral+%28compressed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b77fcc22898073b57797bcf43fcb4580b153069","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,119,252,194,40,152,7,59,87,121,123,207,67,252,180,88,11,21,48,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
