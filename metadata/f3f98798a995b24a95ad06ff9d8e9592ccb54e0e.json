and starts with the band petitioning the        \n         Democratic National Committee to perform a Grover            \n         Cleveland rally song at the convention of 1888. However,     \n         they decide to move to the Dakota territory instead due      \n         to the insistence of their eldest daughter's suitor.         \n         Grandpa Bower starts a little trouble when they get to       \n         Dakota with his pro Grover Cleveland ideas because the       \n         area is overwhelmingly republican. The people of the         \n         Dakota territory are trying to have the area admitted to     \n         the union as two separate states (South Dakota and North     \n         Dakota) in order to acquire 4 republican senators rather     \n         than just two. Cleveland blocks their plans and ends up      \n         winning the election but allows Dakota to be recognized      \n         as two separate states before he leaves office.              \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                               RIP NOTES                              \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           This is not your average Disney movie, and perhaps         \n         more of an American history lesson, though it still          \n         exhibits many typical Disney qualities of its time. No       \n         60s Disney story can be properly told without song and       \n         dance, and certainly not one about a family band! This       \n         was actually not originally intended as a musical, but       \n         after Walt Disney heard the title track by the Sherman       \n         Brothers, they were commissioned to write a number of        \n         songs for the film. Like a spoonful of sugar, this was       \n         presumably seen as a recipe for success, and the most        \n         productive movie songwriting team in history did their       \n         best with the material they had to work with.                \n                                                                      \n           Based on the biography by Laura Bower van Nuys, an         \n         original member of the original (and genuine, and one        \n         and only) family band, Robert Sherman felt the subject       \n         matter was far more mundane than that of, say, Mary          \n         Poppins, but they still completed 11 original songs for      \n         the film.                                                    \n                                                                      \n           Several stars of the day were also cast, including         \n         Buddy Ebsen, Walter Brennan, John Davidson and Lesley        \n         Ann Warren. Curiously, this also starred two future          \n         household names; Kurt Russell (said to have been a           \n         personal favorite of Walt's) and Goldie Hawn. The first      \n         time they met was on the set, though it would be another     \n         15 years until they got together.                            \n                                                                      \n           Enjoy!                                                     \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                               WHO WE ARE                             \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to preserving         \n         the neglected titles of an entertainment era long gone.      \n         A time of classic kids flicks, painstaking hand-drawn        \n         animation and countless cheesy low-budget horrors. A         \n         time when pop had a King, and rock had a Queen. A time       \n         when special FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of       \n         their many tools.                                            \n                                                                      \n           Driven by nostalgia and memories of better days, we        \n         seek to relive those times, and share those memories.        \n         While our belief is that the 80s represent the very          \n         pinnacle of pop culture, we will not limit ourselves         \n         to one decade, or any single genre. We will not ignore       \n         the movies considered insignificant or even embarrassing     \n         by the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece just       \n         because it is dated.                                         \n                                                                      \n           Whereas most groups rely solely on digital sources,        \n         there are still thousands of rare and out of print           \n         titles, many of which have no planned digital release.       \n         We've made it our mission to dig these out, clean them       \n         up using the best hardware and techniques available to       \n         us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS, Laserdisc      \n         or more exotic formats, we're here to bring you the best     \n         (and worst!) of decades past. So sit back and enjoy as       \n         we uncover and pay tribute to an age of cinema we will       \n         never get back.                                              \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                                 THANKS                               \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           To everyone that has supported us over the years and       \n         managed to keep this fun!                                    \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n            AEN  AEROHOLiCS  SChiZO  FLS  SiCK  BLooDWeiSeR           \n                                                                      \n            FiCO  TheWretched  VH-PROD  HUMANiSM  BLooDLiTE           \n                                                                      \n            EPiSODE  VoMiT  ALLiANCE  FRAGMENT  SAPHiRE  xV           \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                  \n                           \n                                 \n                      nFO: asphyx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3f98798a995b24a95ad06ff9d8e9592ccb54e0e","amp;dn":"The.One.And.Only.Genuine.Original.Family.Band.1968.DVDRip.XviD-F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3f98798a995b24a95ad06ff9d8e9592ccb54e0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,249,135,152,169,149,178,74,149,173,6,255,157,142,149,146,204,181,78,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
