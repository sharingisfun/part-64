Chronicling 56-year-old HasilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s boozing, womanizing and law-breaking, audiences are treated to some surreal jaw-dropping antics and raucous, homegrown rock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ roll. Viewers will delight in the various ancedotes of paranoia as related by cronies, acquaintances and authorities.\n\nFilming takes place in Adkins' own yard, his shack, and at various concerts. Adkins is notable for helping create an entirely new form of rock/rockabilly/country fusion, which he plays entirely by himself (with a guitar and drums simultaneously).\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4693c61081d89859553061212efaedaa449f069","amp;dn":"The+Wild+World+of+Hasil+Adkins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4693c61081d89859553061212efaedaa449f069","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,105,60,97,8,29,137,133,149,83,6,18,18,239,174,218,164,73,240,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
