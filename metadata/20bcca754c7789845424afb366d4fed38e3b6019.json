Ethan, one of the townÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s residents, is a young father but not much more than a kid himself. He has no choice but to look after his three-year-old son Nate, since mom Cindy is an alcoholic. But one snowy day, EthanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s good intentions are thwarted by a moment of thoughtlessness, resulting in tragedy. A local prosecutor haunted by his past goes after Ethan, and the ensuing confusion and casting of blame begins to tear the town apart.\n\nGenre: Drama\nIMDB rating: 8.0/10 from 49 users\nDirected by: Gaby Dellal\nStarring: Colin A.
