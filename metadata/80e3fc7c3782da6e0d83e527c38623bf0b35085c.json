Rob is on a mission to breed the perfect pet pigs and we will follow his sows to see if they can deliver the best litter yet!\nWe also meet sailing instructor Joe Pester and his wife Lindy who are preparing for their perfect lakeside wedding - a fitting celebration for their love of the Lake District.\nWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll also catch up with hotelier Thomas The Gladiator Noblett and his right hand man Andrew The Admiral Tighe.
