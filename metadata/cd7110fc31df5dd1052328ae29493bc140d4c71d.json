It allows you to delegate some of the administration to your colleagues and to offer your users a single password change counter irrespective of the platform used.\n\nMDS also has a rich and documented API so that you can easily populate an existing directory.\n\nFive-year maintenance\n\nLike our other versions, Mandriva Enterprise Server has a basic life cycle of five years (until 2014).\n\nMaintenance involves the regular supply of updates to the server software (security and bug fixes).\n\nLSB 4.0 certification\n\nLinux Standard Base (LSB) develops and promotes a set of standards enabling inter-operatibility and compatibility between different Linux-based distributions.\n These enable applications to run seamlessly on any LSB-compliant system.\n\nLSB helps software vendors coordination to port or build their applications to LSB.\n\nAbout Mandriva\n\nMandriva Linux was launched in 1998 under the name of Mandrake Linux, with the goal of making Linux easier to use for everyone.\n At that time, Linux was already well-known as a powerful and stable operating system that demanded strong technical knowledge and extensive use of the command line;\n MandrakeSoft saw this as an opportunity to integrate the best graphical desktop environments and contribute its own graphical configuration utilities to quickly become famous for setting the standard in Linux ease of use.\n\nIn February 2005, MandrakeSoft merged with Brazil's Conectiva to form Mandriva S.A., with headquarters in Paris, France.\n The company's flagship product, Mandriva Linux, offers all the power and stability of Linux to both individuals and professional users in an easy-to-use and pleasant environment.\n\n\n\nA server to reduce your operating costs and simplify the management of your infrastructure.\n\n\nReduce your costs\n\n\nStandardized.\n\nEnterprise Server 5.2 is LSB 4.0 certified.\n\n\nMore free time.\n\nSimplified day-to-day operation.\n\n\nGreener.\n\nYou can cut down on the number of machines and on your electricity consumption.\n\n\n2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014.\n\nExpected lifetime of 5 years.\n\n\n\nSimplify the management of your services\nInstallation &amp; administration\nFile sharing and printer sharing (Samba, CUPS, WebDAV)\nMessaging (Postfix, Cyrus, Sympa, Mailman, SpamAssassin)\nWeb hosting (Apache, MySQL, PHP, Tomcat)\nNetwork management (Bind, Nagios, Netfilter)\nBack-ups (Bacula)\nDirectory (MDS)\nVirtualisation (KVM, Xen)\nand more...\n\n\nAll iso install well and boot and dual boot are ok.\n\nAll iso are from March 2011\n\nMandriva server enterprise 5.2___________edition 2011\n\n\n\n---------------&gt; direct links :\n\n\nEnglish :\n\n\n(http://www.mandriva.com/en/linux/server/)\n\n(http://doc.mandriva.com/en/mes5/Enterprise-Server-Manual-EN.html/)\n\n(http://doc.mandriva.com/en/mes5/Enterprise-Server-Manual-EN.html/index.html)\n\n\nFrench :\n\n\n(http://doc.mandriva.com/index-fr.php)\n\n(http://www.mandriva.com/fr/linux/server/)\n\n(http://doc.mandriva.com/fr/mes5/Enterprise-Server-Manual-FR.html/index.html)\n\n\n________________________________\n\n\nDetails for each iso :\n\n\n\nMD5 :\n2a708459365c769873d89583060091f8  MES5-corporate-5.2-i586.iso\n\nSHA1 :\n9644c63bdecdb796bf97f2be8dd38e9201c69214  MES5-corporate-5.2-i586.iso\n\n____________________\n\nMD5 :\n4895f3db460d9adb586aff74ac1905bd  MES5-corporate-5.2-x86_64.iso\n\nSHA1:\n7f83c852b97acf85f46c5d7a0e0a4fcf74084a22  MES5-corporate-5.2-x86_64.iso\n\n____________________\n\nMD5 :\nc3adb92be9a5b6c14c6f056889113d88  MES5-corporate-5.2-dual.iso\n\nSHA1 :\n44d96c3c3ded26125063ae9544647fa88b40ab45  MES5-corporate-5.2-dual.iso\n\n\nYou can select only what you want before starting this torrent or download all iso and pdf docs in french only,sorry !\nuse a suffisant up speed,please,to download this torrent.\nEnjoy\nbest regards","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd7110fc31df5dd1052328ae29493bc140d4c71d","amp;dn":"Mandriva+server+5.2_2011%28x86+%26+x64%29+%2B+dual+boot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd7110fc31df5dd1052328ae29493bc140d4c71d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,113,16,252,49,223,93,209,5,35,40,174,41,73,59,193,64,212,199,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
