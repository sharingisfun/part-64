The best way to describe Thumpies is a rhythm game crossed with juggling. Players tap the screen to match the beat of bouncing Thumpies, creating layers of a song. If the player taps the targets in time, their Thump-o-Meter slowly rises, but if the player misses or taps out of time, the meter falls. Unlike typical rhythm based games, Thumpies uses a mechanic of bouncing in time instead of just a series of notes.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bigbluebubble.com/index.php?page=game_detail&amp;cat_id=114&amp;game_id=561&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bigbluebubble.com/index.php?page=game_detail&amp;cat_id=114&amp;game_id=561&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:702f6654ca229d727bde6dcbaf705143a7e7c493","amp;dn":"Thumpies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"702f6654ca229d727bde6dcbaf705143a7e7c493","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,47,102,84,202,34,157,114,123,222,109,203,175,112,81,67,167,231,196,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
