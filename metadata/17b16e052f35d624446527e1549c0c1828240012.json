Mobs firebombed police stations and sets shops on fire in London, Manchester, Salford, Liverpool, Nottingham and Birmingham. After waiting for several days, Prime Minister David Cameron has cut short his vacation and recalled Parliament from summer recess. Scotland Yard has ordered its officers to deploy every available force to stop the unrest, including water cannons and possibly the use of plastic bullets. London has been flooded with 16,000 officers, the largest police presence in the city's history. We go to London to speak with journalist Darcus Howe, a longtime critic of police brutality in black and West Indian communities across the U.K., and author and blogger Richard Seymour of the popular British site &quot;Lenin's Tomb.&quot; &quot;There is a mass insurrection - and I am not talking about rioting - I am talking about an insurrection that comes from the depths of society, from the consciousness collectively of the young blacks and whites, but overwhelmingly black, as a result of the consistent stopping and searching young blacks without cause,&quot; says Howe of the uprising. Seymour notes that anti-terror legislation has led to an unprecedented number of stops, predominantly of youth of color, but protests against the stops have been largely ignored by the British media. &quot;A political establishment, a media, and a state system that gives people ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ the impression that they will not be listened to, unless they force themselves on to your attention, is going to lead to riots,&quot; says Seymour.\n\n\n- Anti-Union Law Fuels Massive Voter Turnout For Historic Wisconsin Recall\n\nRepublicans have retained control of the Wisconsin State Senate following a series of historic recall elections organized in response to their support of Gov. Scott Walker's union-busting bill this spring. Democrats needed to win three of the six Republican seats up for grabs in order to gain a majority, but four incumbents prevailed. Independent video producer Sam Mayfield spoke with voters at polling stations in the contested districts of Republican State Senators Alberta Darling and Luther Olsen in southern Wisconsin. She filed this report for Democracy Now!.\n\n\n- WI Recall Marks Labor Win; Election Funds Raise Question if U.S. is a &quot;Democracy or Dollar-ocracy?&quot;\n\nFor analysis on the Wisconsin recall vote, we go to Madison to speak with John Nichols, Washington correspondent for The Nation magazine. Although Republicans hold on to a slim 17-to-16 majority after the election, Nichols says the Democrats' pick-up of two seats, coupled with the moderate stance of Republican State Sen. Bill Schulz, amounts to a new &quot;pro-labor majority&quot; in the Wisconsin State Senate. &quot;Gov. Scott Walker took a hit last night,&quot; Nichols says. &quot;Even though Democrats didn't win, progressive politics made a real advance.&quot; Some $30 million was spent by outside groups on the Wisconsin recall. Looking forward to the 2012 national election Nichols says the &quot;biggest message from Wisconsin&quot; is that &quot;we are going to see absolutely unprecedented amounts of money coming into our politics and have to ask ourselves the question, do we have a democracy or a dollar-ocracy?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17b16e052f35d624446527e1549c0c1828240012","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+10+aug+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17b16e052f35d624446527e1549c0c1828240012","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,177,110,5,47,53,214,36,68,101,39,225,84,156,12,24,40,36,0,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
