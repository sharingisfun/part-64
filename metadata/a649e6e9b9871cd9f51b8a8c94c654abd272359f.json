He discovers that the source is in central Africa and,        \n    backed by the nations of the world, sets out on an expedition. Bruce     \n    learns that the disturbances emanate from an area called the Magnetic    \n    Mountain. But unknown to our hero and his pal Jerry, the Magnetic        \n    Mountain also contains a super-advanced secret city ruled by the         \n    tyrannical scientific wizard named Zolok, who has unleashed the          \n    electrical fury threatening civilization as part of his plan to          \n    conquer the world. Zolok has under his control a brilliant inventor,     \n    Manyus, Manyus' beautiful daughter Natcha and an army of giant           \n    African slaves, who follow the dictates of a strongman, Appolyn, and     \n    Gorza, a dwarf. Also in the mix are schemers Reynolds and Colton, who    \n    plan to capture Manyus and thereby gain control of Zolok's army, and     \n    a double-crossing fellow explorer named Butterfield. Can Bruce evade     \n    Zolok's &quot;destroying rays&quot; and stop his dreams of world conquest?         \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
