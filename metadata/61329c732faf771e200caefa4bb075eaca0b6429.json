With only a loyalty to his lazy best friend Edgar, a dead-end job where his employees step on him, and the good-ol' days, Shaun isn't exactly putting his best foot forward. But when the flesh-hungry undead start to rise in numbers around modern-day London, Shaun must come to the rescue of his girlfriend and mother before all hell breaks loose. With loyal Edgar at his side to fight the good fight, the two will have to pave their way through zombie-ridden London as Shaun must take on the first real challenge in his life--with comical results.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61329c732faf771e200caefa4bb075eaca0b6429","amp;dn":"Shawn+of+the+Dead+%28IPod%2CZune%2CPSP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61329c732faf771e200caefa4bb075eaca0b6429","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,50,156,115,47,175,119,30,32,12,174,250,75,176,117,234,202,11,100,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
