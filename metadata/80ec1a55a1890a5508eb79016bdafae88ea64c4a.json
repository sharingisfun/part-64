Although we may try to keep it tucked at the back of our minds, most of us are aware of our own mortality. But few among us know what science, with the help of insights yielded from groundbreaking new research, has to say about death on a larger scale. Enter astronomer Chris Impey, who chronicles the death of the whole shebang: individual, species, biosphere, Earth, Sun, Milky Way, and, finally, the entire universe. \n\nWith a healthy dose of humor, How It Ends illuminates everything from the technologies of human life extension and the evolutionary arms race between microbes and men to the inescapable dimming of the sun and the ultimate &quot;big rip&quot;, giving us a rare glimpse into a universe without us.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80ec1a55a1890a5508eb79016bdafae88ea64c4a","amp;dn":"How+It+Ends+.+.+.+From+You+to+the+Universe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80ec1a55a1890a5508eb79016bdafae88ea64c4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,236,26,85,161,137,10,85,8,235,121,1,107,218,250,232,142,166,76,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
