Windows 7 is build 7600, this build is 7989. It does have the same installation screen as Windows 7 (A few tweaks to it), but this is not Windows 7. there are a few new features, for example a new bootscreen, a new 'lock' menu near the corner, the titles are centered, and the genuine center. Once you have installed this, go to youtube . com / TheAeroHacker and watch the Windows 8 video. It will instruct you on how to remove the timebomb and unlock more hidden features...\n\nMost WinVista/ Win7 Apps will run on this. the only programs I've had issues with is \nFirefox constantly crashing, and no sound in google chrome. IE9 works fine though\n\n\n\n\nAnd yes, I know I have other torrents that say &quot;Milestone 3&quot; but those are actually Milestone 2. I made a mistake while creating those torrents. I would've changed the name but for The Pirate Bay won't let me rename them...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:724bc67102067a500d9f21f48c34f58d151f9cb4","amp;dn":"%5B64-Bit%5D+Windows+8+Milestone+3+Build+7989","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"724bc67102067a500d9f21f48c34f58d151f9cb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,75,198,113,2,6,122,80,13,159,33,244,140,52,245,141,21,31,156,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
