While there has been a strong demand for a downloadable version - via wii-ware or PC - the developer has stated that while the game is currently not planned to be released on any other formats due to a contract with Retrozone, a possibility for the future still exists.\n\nThis is the actual rom file of the game (.nes)... It's quite rare so please SEED! \n\nI would really appreciate it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83571d81e884c648ee45be1158ec1cfd37db8a4c","amp;dn":"Battle+Kid+-+Fortress+of+Peril.nes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83571d81e884c648ee45be1158ec1cfd37db8a4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,87,29,129,232,132,198,72,238,69,190,17,88,236,28,253,55,219,138,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
