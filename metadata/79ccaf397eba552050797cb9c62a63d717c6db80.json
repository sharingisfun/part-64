In The Name Of The Dance\n\nBlessings is a purely spiritual work of art. This daring album is entirely dedicated to the pagan segment of S.J.\\'s fanbase, and may not be appropriate for all audiences.

Ginger Doss of Dreamtrybe and Velvet Hammer fame describes Blessings as, \\&quot;The most sacred, most highly evolved body of pagan work I have ever experienced.
