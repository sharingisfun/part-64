They are found in modern devices like radio receivers, mobile phones, and GPS systems. This comprehensive resource offers RF and microwave engineers a thorough overview of both well-established and recently developed frequency synthesizer design techniques. Professionals find expert guidance on all design aspects, including main architectures, key building blocks, and practical circuit implementation. Engineers learn the development process and gain a solid understanding of how to build a synthesizer from a basic diagram to the final product.\n\nStarting with a simple single-loop PLL example, the book progressively examines various alternatives -- fractional-N, DDS, frequency offset, multiloop and more to achieve required performance objectives. This unique volume gathers a collection of block diagrams, clever circuits, design recipes, and other hard-to-find information that is usually treated as design secrets . Written in a simple yet rigorous style with numerous illustrations, the book is an all-in-one reference for both beginner and experienced designers.\nAbout the Author\nAlexander Chenakin is the vice president of the Signal Sources Group at Phase Matrix, Inc. He has led the development of advanced products for a number of top microwave companies, including Celeritek, Nextek, Micro Lambda Wireless, and General Electronic Devices. Dr. Chenakin is a Senior Member of the IEEE and has been an invited speaker at several IEEE-sponsored events.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 305 pages\n    * Publisher: Artech House; 1 edition (November 30, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1596932309\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1596932302","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4ebdbaf8205fce4cc4dd03b0afcc0372eeab937","amp;dn":"Frequency+Synthesizers%3A+From+Concept+to+Product%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4ebdbaf8205fce4cc4dd03b0afcc0372eeab937","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,235,219,175,130,5,252,228,204,77,208,59,10,252,192,55,46,234,185,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
