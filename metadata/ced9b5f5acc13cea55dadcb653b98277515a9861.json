This video would tend to send newcomers running to the other fellowship if it didn't turn them away from recovery altogether. The participants are from the directlyresponsible crowd yet the new audio only file links to the website controlled now by the planning group. Directlyresponsible doesn't seem capable of grasping that they destroyed the USFA movement.\n\nKeywords: directlyresponsible.com Bo Sewell Brian &quot;Yelloweyes&quot; Hamptom David Bielut Youtube Narcotics Anonymous comedy losers Tradition violation more will be revealed\n\n\n#\n_redacted_ Hardly a statement of attraction.\nAugust 5 at 8:21pm Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 2 peopleLoading...\n#\n_redacted_ this really pisses me off.. why do these guys think that they have all the answers and everyone else is so wrong... what arrogance...\nAugust 5 at 9:22pm Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· UnlikeLike Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 5 peopleLoading...\n#\n_redacted_ Is what he says supposed to make sense?\nAugust 5 at 10:20pm Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike\n#\n_redacted_ It probably does to them. That is why it is so difficult tofollow their logic.\nAugust 5 at 10:29pm Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 1 person_redacted_ likes this.\n#\n_redacted_ ummmm, well I am 100% in favor of talking about the absolute importance of anonymity while doing an interview about NA on youtube. I must be too new to get it.\nAugust 5 at 10:44pm Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 3 peopleLoading...\n#\n_redacted_ I will be sorry for the sarcasm later.\nAugust 5 at 10:45pm Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 2 peopleLoading...\n#\n_redacted_ As I said: difficult to follow their logic.\nAugust 5 at 10:58pm Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 1 personLoading...\n#\n_redacted_ OK, I have thought it over and I do apologize for my sarcasm. I seldom post here or on the other sites. I will share that in my life when barriers continually are placed in the way of something I am trying to do I need to surrender that my wish is not God's will or God would remove the barriers.\nAugust 5 at 11:06pm Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 1 personLoading...\n#\n_redacted_ Wow, Just checked with the little misses and we are all stocked up on crazy over here.Cubards,fridge and pantry over flowing so we are gonna have to pass on this.\nAugust 5 at 11:30pm Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 3 peopleLoading...\n#\n_redacted_ The video is so absurd that it begs for sarcastic commentary. No apology necessary as far as I am concerned.\nWhat I know is it took up 9+ minutes of my life that will never be returned.\nAugust 5 at 11:32pm Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 6 peopleLoading...\n#\n_redacted_ sorry but I truly didn't understand your comments. Could you guys elaborate please? I don't know about anybody else but I just got home after travelling fired up the computer and saw this scary man with his floating eye ball scaring the beejeezus outta me. It just gave me the creeeps!\nAugust 5 at 11:36pm Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 3 peopleLoading...\n#\n_redacted_ I thought they were all about the traditions.............\nAugust 5 at 11:57pm Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 1 personLoading...\n#\n_redacted_ You have the wrong people, they were all about re-writing the traditions, I guess in their version of the traditions, publicity in the Bill Wilson style is a good thing. Well, I'm off to bed. this is for the birds what I've read so far.\nSaturday at 12:00am Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike\n\n#\n_redacted_ They are all about the Traditions as they apply to those not in agreement with their beliefs.\nSaturday at 12:46am Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 1 personLoading...\n#\n_redacted_... thanks for the sarcasm!! It was funny...and you beat me to it LOL.\nSaturday at 1:01am Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 1 personLoading...\n#\n_redacted_ yes she did!\nSaturday at 1:04am Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 2 peopleLoading...\n#\n_redacted_ I must be losing my touch!\nSaturday at 1:08am Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike\n#\n_redacted_ &lt;&lt;we are all stocked up on crazy over here.&gt;&gt; LOL LOL\nSaturday at 1:27am Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike\n#\n_redacted_ I am astonished. That is the person who on David B's FB group said that he wanted &quot;to hurt me and go to jail.&quot; The uploader is David B who I will _redacted_\nSaturday at 2:06am Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 2 peopleLoading...\n\n#\n_redacted_ Just saying crazy is as crazy does.For the life of me I cannot understand what the heck they were thinking by posting this.I have always been taught we went to carry a clear message and to tell the truth as quickley and as simple as possiable. I have a question, why would anyone with a loved one in active addiction suggest that suffering person go get well with a fellowship with these beliefs. KRAZY\nSaturday at 8:41am Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike\n#\n_redacted_ I don't think anyone not in the fellowship will really understand what is being talked about in this video. As far as the rest of us go, we'll just have to decide whether this guy is the Moses that he thinks he is, or more like the Charlie Sheen that he actually is. Hopefully he doesn't fool too many people. That is what is actually tearing our fellowship apart.\nSaturday at 11:14am Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 2 peopleLoading...\n#\n_redacted_ By the way, the video is now &quot;private&quot; whatever that means.\nSaturday at 11:17am Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 1 personLoading...\n#\n_redacted_ I downloaded it first! Screw private.\nSaturday at 11:54am via Facebook Mobile Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike\n#\n_redacted_ I only placed it on here so you can be aware of what is being sent out. It is odd that it became &quot;private&quot; after such a short time.\nSaturday at 12:33pm Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike\n#\n_redacted_ private means that you have to know the direct kink otherwise it will not show up in any search or &quot;related&quot; videos list.\nSaturday at 3:02pm Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike\n#\n_redacted_ Actually, I went to youtube and it told me I had to have permission from the one who posted.\nSaturday at 3:04pm Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 1 personLoading...\n#\n_redacted_..they took it to level two. I'm sure someone who has downloaded it will post it somewhere.\nSaturday at 3:07pm Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike\n#\n_redacted_ Yeah, I watched it before it was made private, I just thought it was ironic that they recanted after having gone forward with such a thing. Maybe there is hope.\nSaturday at 3:09pm Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike\n#\n_redacted_..they didn;t recant.. they just made it private .. you can be sure they are sharing the link with others.\nSaturday at 3:15pm Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike\n#\n_redacted_ These people seem incapable of grasping that there is anyone not tripping over themselves to agree with them. I'm sure the uploader with his &quot;anarchist&quot; views posted the video without permission and was aghast when he saw some negative comments left, then quickly changed the video from &quot;unlisted&quot; to &quot;private&quot;. I downloaded the file in anticipation of that and will upload it when I get back home tomorrow or Monday. Anybody up for doing some video editing? Wait...can't really improve on that performance. Bet I go to hell for that.\nSunday at 5:28am Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 2 peopleLoading...\n#\n\n\n#\n_redacted_ ith, that is the nature of their &quot;informal service&quot;, no group conscience involved here.\nSunday at 7:24am Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike\n#\n_redacted_ I was using the word recant more sarcastically than seriously.\nSunday at 9:16am Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· LikeUnlike Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 1 personLoading...\n#\n_redacted_, that is a very funny expression, I'm going to use it with my students in Sept. Thank you!\nSunday at 8:40pm Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Like","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ced9b5f5acc13cea55dadcb653b98277515a9861","amp;dn":"USSC+Proposal+-+One+Member%5C%27s+View","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ced9b5f5acc13cea55dadcb653b98277515a9861","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,217,181,245,172,193,60,234,85,218,220,182,83,185,130,119,81,90,152,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
