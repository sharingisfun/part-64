Eery backup job is either a ZIP-compressed folder or copies of the files and folders.\n\nCombine several folders and files to one backup job, which will be running after an individual schedule. For that, different intervals are available like daily, weekly, monthly, once or several times a day, week or month. You can choose the point of time for the backup to the minute.\n\nThe backup to a ZIP-compressed folder is a ZIP-file and can be opened with the most package programs. Additionally, priority and compression rate of each backup job are user defined.\n\nBecause RealTimeBackup needs very less computing time, you can still work on during the backup is running. Even some files can be saved which are still in use. Save your files on any medium you want except streamer.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b32c29fdba7e14c7c686328d17a2060ac64d3c2","amp;dn":"GBelectronics+RealTimeBackup+2.00.229+Bilingual+with+SERIAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b32c29fdba7e14c7c686328d17a2060ac64d3c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,50,194,159,219,167,225,76,124,104,99,40,209,122,32,96,172,100,211,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
