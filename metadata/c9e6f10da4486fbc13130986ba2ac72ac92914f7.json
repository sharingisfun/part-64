I found it and decided to upload it to share. \n\nEnjoy.\n\nThis is the REDAKAI universe, where good and evil are locked in an intense struggle for the same mysterious energy force: Kairu. In the hands of good, Kairu is a living force that guides the universe. But in the hands of evil, Kairu can be a destructive force unlike anything else. Those who learn to wield this energy become Kairu Warriors, and they aspire to join the ranks of the most powerful Kairu masters: The Redakai.\n\nMany years ago, a great battle took place between two powerful Redakai masters, Boaddai and Lokar -- a battle that would forever change the fate of the universe. Known today as the Great Cataclysm, the event resulted in the destruction of the planet Nevrod and the scattering of Kairu energy across Earth.\n\nThe Redakai of Earth have assigned their most promising warriors to find and collect Kairu energy. Their greatest challenge remains the villainous Lokar, who has assembled his own teams of warriors to find the Kairu before the Redakai. With the fate of the universe at stake, good and evil are put to the ultimate test.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9e6f10da4486fbc13130986ba2ac72ac92914f7","amp;dn":"Redakai.Conquer.the.Kairu.Episode.01.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9e6f10da4486fbc13130986ba2ac72ac92914f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,230,241,13,164,72,111,188,19,19,9,134,186,42,199,42,201,41,20,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
