Thibodeau and his bandmates have put together five extremely well-crafted folk tunes that, as others have noted, are sure to garner the band significant attention from the usual suspects...but also from beyond those communities, if there\\'s any justice. The band is extremely tight-sounding, while the presence of an upright bass gives songs like \\&quot;One Design of Teeth\\&quot; and \\&quot;Tippin\\' Boats\\&quot; the hint of a jazzy swingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½- iheartmusic.net\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhen this Ottawa three-piece kicks off their debut EP with the country rock, road trip ready Tipping Boats, you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t help but be won overÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½- herohill.com\n\n\nThe John Punch Band will be heading back to the Church where they recorded their 2009 E.P to start recording their first full lenght in September of 2011.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thejohnpunchband.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thejohnpunchband.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce45d42a23b1c72c67464a44bdcfda9918cffa32","amp;dn":"The+John+Punch+Band-%282007+to+2009..%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce45d42a23b1c72c67464a44bdcfda9918cffa32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,69,212,42,35,177,199,44,103,70,74,68,189,207,218,153,24,207,250,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
