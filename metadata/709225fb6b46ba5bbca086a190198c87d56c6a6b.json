Down To The River [Live]\n\n________________________________________\n\nAll 111 tracks -- and not a weak one among them -- that Rose Maddox cut for Capitol Records between 1959-1965,\nincluding seven numbers (one live) with Buck Owens, spread among four CDs and topped off with a 16-page\nbooklet. As usual, the quality is excellent, in addition to the material being exceptionally attractive.\nMaddox's singing (sometimes joined by her brother, John, or Buck Owens) is powerful throughout, whether she's\nintroducing new numbers like &quot;Custer's Last Stand&quot; or &quot;Lies And Alibis,&quot; or covering familiar territory like\nHank Thompson's &quot;Whoa Sailor&quot; or Hank Williams' &quot;Honky Tonkin',&quot; or Woody Guthrie's &quot;Philadelphia Lawyer.&quot; Her\nhonky tonk numbers are in a class by themselves, among the boldest material in this vein ever cut by a woman,\nand hearing it, it's easy to understand why her influence crosses generational lines in country music -- she\nwas well ahead of her time. But it's also filled with surprises: her wonderfully robust and raspy rendition of\n&quot;Honky Tonkin',&quot; which could melt a lumberjack's chain saw, but also features a jewel of a mandolin break that\nwould be a blessing on any bluegrass record; a frantic, rockabilly-flavored version of Williams' &quot;Move It On\nOver&quot; that ought to be part of any serious rock &amp; roll collection; an enticing (and rocking) version of Tommy\nCollins' &quot;Down Down Down&quot; (never on any album); a stunningly moving version of &quot;Please Help Me I'm Falling,&quot;\nwhich was later buried by Hank Locklin's version, recorded after but issued just a few weeks ahead of Maddox's;\na dozen gospel numbers (most notably &quot;That Glory Bound Train&quot;) that are among the most sincere, exuberant,\nupbeat, and rousing songs of their kind ever assembled in one place; and a killer live rendition of Buck Owens'\n&quot;Down To The River&quot; cut at an Owens concert in Bakersfield in September 1963. The complete contents of her albums --\nincluding &quot;The One Rose&quot;, &quot;Glorybound Train&quot;, and &quot;Rose Maddox Sings Bluegrass&quot; -- are here, along with the dozens\nof tracks that the label never found room on its roster to release. The booklet is also fascinating, explaining\nhow Maddox came to record so much and release so little during her years with Capitol (more than a third of the\ncontents here have never been heard before), and how she came to be dropped from the label along with other\ncountry legends like Hank Thompson.\n\n-- Bruce Eder\n\nThe reviewer is wrong about the live version of &quot;Down To The River&quot; being from a Buck Owens concert. It actually comes from a very rare Capitol LP (that ought to be reissued in it's entirety) called &quot;The Hootenanny Album.&quot; It was a live album from the Bakersfield Civic Center in celebration of the tenth anniversary of Cousin Herb Henson's &quot;Trading Post&quot; television show. If you're not familiar with Cousin Herb Henson, here are a couple of links : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb_Henson http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=14612816\n\nOh and apparently at some point during the planning stages for this set, the title was going to be &quot;Sing A Little Song Of Heartache&quot; because that's what it says on all the cd inlays. I don't know if they ever changed it on future pressings. I bought it when it first came out.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:709225fb6b46ba5bbca086a190198c87d56c6a6b","amp;dn":"Rose+Maddox+-+The+One+Rose-The+Capitol+Years++%5B4+disc+set%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"709225fb6b46ba5bbca086a190198c87d56c6a6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,146,37,251,107,70,186,91,188,160,134,161,144,25,140,135,213,108,106,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
