There are songs I recorded as a testament to that. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s basically a conceptual album, a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwhat ifÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the world went through some sort of catastrophic event like a global nuclear war, apocalyptic type thing. WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s left after that? Not much, many deaths, a lot of sick people, some people who will try to take advantage of the situations etc. So The Conqueror is like the hero &amp; a mercy killer in these days &amp; times. I wanted this to be like a movie on disc or MP3ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s. Thanks to a lot of MC friends, DJÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &amp; producers (especially DJ Extremidiz). WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve crafted a project that I feel really hits the nail on the head &amp; accomplished what we set out to do with this.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Gage\n\nFull Track-listing\n\n01.
