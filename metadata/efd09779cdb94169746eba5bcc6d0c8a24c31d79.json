I ain't talkin' 'bout monkey junk!&quot; MonkeyJunk is a band that draws heavily on the legends of the blues and translates that influence into a contemporary blend of swamp R&amp;B, soul boogie and bedroom funk. This triple threat trio comprised of Steve Marriner, Tony D and Matt Sobb draws on over 56 years of combined experience playing blues live and in studio . . . and it shows.\n\nIn the fall of 2008, MonkeyJunk was nominated for a Maple Blues Award for best new artist - a rare feat only having been in existence for 6 months and not having released a record yet . . . In February 2009, MonkeyJunk represented Ottawa, Canada at The International Blues Challenge held in Memphis, TN competing amongst 100 bands from nine different countries. After the smoke cleared on Beale St., MonkeyJunk had placed third overall!\n\nTONY D - guitar, slide guitar, vocals\nSTEVE MARRINER - guitar, baritone guitar, harmonica, Hammond organ, vocals\nMATT SOBB - drums, cymbals, various percussion\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efd09779cdb94169746eba5bcc6d0c8a24c31d79","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+MonkeyJunk+-+Tiger+In+Your+Tank","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efd09779cdb94169746eba5bcc6d0c8a24c31d79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,208,151,121,205,185,65,105,116,110,186,91,204,109,12,138,36,195,29,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
