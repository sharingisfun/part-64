Yukio and Wolverine are \nthen ambushed by pirates and easily dispatch them. Logan goes on ahead \nleaving Yukio to handle the pirates alone. At night as Logan reaches another \nshoreline, vagrants jump him only to be shocked at his power. Two bikers \nchain Wolverine's leg from a motorcycle and drive him to a post and hang him \nupside-down. Not showing any concern, Logan cuts himself down and takes the motorbike. \nAs soon as a mob of people come after him, a young girl throws knives at the men, \nkilling them. The girl states that she saved Logan in hopes that he could work with her, \nbut he turns her down. After she says she works with others who try and stop Kurohagi, \nLogan wants answers. She questions his reasons for wanting to kill Kurohagi, \nbut he will not answer. She tells Logan where to find Kurohagi, in the most brightly \nlit tower on the island called Dragon Palace. Meanwhile, blindfolded Yashida cuts \ncandles off a table and lines them up along the flat side of his katana, entertaining \nguests to his daughter's wedding, and throws them on to pillars of a gold statue of \nKurohagi's father. As Kurohagi thanks Yashida for the show, a subordinate tells him \nthat Logan is on the island. Despite Min's warnings, Logan still chooses to go. \nKnowing now Wolverine is on the island, Kurohagi sends the behemoth Vadhaka to \ntake him which sends tremors through the island. \nThe creature lands in front of Logan stating he will not pass \n  \n \nSpoken Language: English\n-------------------------------------------\n\nScreens:\n---------\n[URL=http://img163.imageshack.us/i/wolverine106minojavithu.jpg/][IMG]http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/9818/wolverine106minojavithu.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 148M\nPlayTime           : 00:19:57.497\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : XVID\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 420 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 29.970fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 35889\nVideoBitRate       : 901282\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 128000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 44100\n\nFormat: Avi\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nHash:\n------\nF10E04C97C27AB0602F7DCA1B71FAE00DA13735E\n--------------------------------\n[/center]\n\n\nJoin us at #Cartoon_Palace onfor more Cartoons and Anime.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f10e04c97c27ab0602f7dca1b71fae00da13735e","amp;dn":"Wolverine+-+106+-+Min+%5BOj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f10e04c97c27ab0602f7dca1b71fae00da13735e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,14,4,201,124,39,171,6,2,247,220,161,183,31,174,0,218,19,115,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
