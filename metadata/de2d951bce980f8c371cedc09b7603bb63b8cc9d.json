ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œi know some of you will still hate cause of the fact that hating if your game but i have now explained it and take it or leave it. i donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to prove myself that iÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´m able to mix iÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´ve done that my whole life and spend more time mixing then with my daughter so thats it.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nWith angry followers continuing the conflict online Angello penned another lengthy response even challenging a so called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“haterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ to face off with him behind the decks.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t you have better things to do then make up bullshit to write about me faking a whole set when i just explained that it was the last 11 mins of my set so they could fire of the special fx and all the fireworks, stop with your bullshit and get on with your lives, if it would be up to you guys we would all be stuck in cells without electricity and banging on a floor without a big show so you would feel better for yourselves not being there, i would never fake a whole set in my entire life and those 10 mins are part of the show. if you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t wanna see fireworks and a massive finale stop buying tickets to events where that happens and stay home instead. i hate when people make up a big story and feed on it like sugar to ants. make something better of your time instead of wasting mine!! if you would put as much time on your own careers as you do talking shit maybe a thing like this wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t affect you, i know who my real fans are and you haters are not my real fans, cause if you would be you would get what iÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´m saying after seeing the shows we do, you probably havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even been to any of my shows and wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t ever come so drop it, get on with your lives! I wanna take this Hater thing to the next level. I wanna fly one over to ibiza to play with my SD cards without headphones and put it on youtube. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll do the same directly after and weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll see if you can pull it off. ? IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll pick one of you guys and weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll go for it.
