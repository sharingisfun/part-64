The film recreates, with nostalgia, drama, and opulence, the tumultuous years of ItalyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s RisorgimentoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½when the aristocracy lost its grip and the middle classes rose and formed a unified, democratic Italy. Burt Lancaster stars as the aging prince watching his culture and fortune wane in the face of a new generation, represented by his upstart nephew (Alain Delon) and his beautiful fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e (Claudia Cardinale). Awarded the Palme dOr at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival, The Leopard translates Giuseppe Tomasi di LampedusaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s novel, and the history it recounts, into a truly cinematic masterpiece.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1efcfab4c87341b2e2263c40fed05fd03542d36","amp;dn":"The+Leopard+%281963%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1efcfab4c87341b2e2263c40fed05fd03542d36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,239,207,171,76,135,52,27,46,34,99,196,15,237,5,253,3,84,45,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
