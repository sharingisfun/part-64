I am just a fan. Putting together these torrents is something that I have been meaning to do for a while, and I thought this might be an appropriate time, since at the moment there is some drama going on the Red Bar world, and I would imagine there won't be any shows or updates for a while.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n  At the moment, there are FOUR seperate torrents. They are as follows:\n\nTHE RED BAR RADIO TIME MACHINE TORRENT - 2009\nTHE RED BAR RADIO TIME MACHINE TORRENT - 2008\nTHE RED BAR RADIO TIME MACHINE TORRENT - 2007\nTHE BEST OF RED BAR RADIO TORRENT\n\n  The contents of the torrents are as follows:\n\nAll of the &quot;TIME MACHINE&quot; torrents combined contain EVERY show spanning from 05-01-2009 back to 04-02-2007. For reference, at the time these torrents were made, 05-01-2009 is where the podcast feed on iTunes stops, and 04-02-2007 is as far back as I have at the moment. I split them into chunks so that people will be more likely to only download what they need. I also want to make a torrent of any shows I can find that PREDATE 04-02-2007. If you have any, PLEASE email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6807040c0d18011b070c0d1b280f05090104460b0705&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; and let me know! I don't have any, and I don't know anyone who has any.\n\nThe &quot;BEST OF&quot; torrent contains 53 of my favorite Red Bar shows. I added numbers to the beginning of their filenames so that if you are viewing them in a file browser, they will be in order. It also included a playlist file for your convenience (.m3u).\n\n\n************\n IMPORTANT!\n************\n\nIf you have any episodes of Red Bar that PREDATE 04-02-2007 (April 2, 2007), please email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;ee81828a8b9e879d818a8b9dae89838f8782c08d8183&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; - I am trying to put together a torrent of episodes that predate that time. You know, shows from the Biggs &amp; Kyle days, and when Panama Black, Ron, and Dani were around. I am not including the &quot;first episodes&quot; of Red Bar, because they are Barmy content. Someone out there has to have some, so spread the word!\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be0c5244fa38a6db415dfdce789e8db3583318af","amp;dn":"THE+BEST+OF+RED+BAR+RADIO+%28Re-upload%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be0c5244fa38a6db415dfdce789e8db3583318af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,12,82,68,250,56,166,219,65,93,253,206,120,158,141,179,88,51,24,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
