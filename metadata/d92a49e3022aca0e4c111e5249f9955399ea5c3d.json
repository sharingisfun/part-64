When they are unable to reconcile, Lily and Herman each see a marriage counselor independently.\n\n\n#25  Come Back, Little Googie\nGrandpa is under the impression that he's turned Eddie's friend Googie into a monkey. The truth is that the little boy is hiding to fool the Munsters. \nNOTE: Billy Mumy was the original choice for Eddie Munster, but his parents said no because of all of the makeup requirements. Billy made many appearances as a child, but is best known as Will Robinson from Lost in Space.\n\n\n#26  Far-Out Munsters\nThe Standells, a rock group from Hollywood, are in town for a club appearance. They want a secluded place to stay in order to escape from their screaming teenage fans. Their manager pays an exorbitant fee to the Munsters to use their house for the weekend. The Munsters pack up and relocate to a hotel, but they can't get adjusted to its cleanliness and normality.  When they arrive home prematurely, they find The Standells singing, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand,&quot; and throwing a wild party filled with far-out beatniks and hipsters.  The Munsters are initially shocked, but soon find that they fit in with these freaky people - who never once question their unusual appearance. Guest stars: The Standells as themselves and Zalman King as the Man With Beard.\n\n\n#27  Munsters on the Move\nIn order to accept a promotion, Herman has to shuffle his family off to Buffalo. Eddie, who happens to be doing great on the baseball team, throws a temper tantrum. Since Grandpa has already sold the house to a wrecking company, the Munsters have no choice but to wage war.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d92a49e3022aca0e4c111e5249f9955399ea5c3d","amp;dn":"The+Munsters+24_27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d92a49e3022aca0e4c111e5249f9955399ea5c3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,42,73,227,2,42,202,14,76,17,30,82,73,249,149,83,153,234,92,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
