It's a place rigged with hundreds of social landmines, not the least of which are morons, wedgies, swirlies, bullies, lunchtime banishment to the cafeteria floor - and a festering piece of cheese with nuclear cooties. To survive the never-ending ordeal and attain the recognition and status he feels he so richly deserves, Greg devises an endless series of can't-miss schemes, all of which, of course, go awry. And he's getting it all down on paper, via a diary - &quot;it's NOT a diary, it's a journal!&quot; Greg insists, preferring the less-sissyfied designation - filled with his opinions, thoughts, tales of family trials and tribulations, and (would-be) schoolyard triumphs. &quot;One day when I'm famous,&quot; writes Greg, &quot;I'll have better things to do than answer peoples' stupid questions all day.&quot; So was born the Wimpy Kid's diary","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb808de571d8fd05dc1f6228d0ce56770c82f600","amp;dn":"Diary+Of+The+Wimpy+Kid+-+2010+720p+Mr.MOViES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb808de571d8fd05dc1f6228d0ce56770c82f600","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,128,141,229,113,216,253,5,220,31,98,40,208,206,86,119,12,130,246,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
