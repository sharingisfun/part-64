Its popular and user-friendly interface has been carried over from RPG MAKER 2000, and its graphic capabilities, battle screen layout, and data packaging features are better than ever! By popular demand, this latest installment also contains a brand-new Scripting function. RPG MAKER XP is perfect for beginners and experts alike.\n\nRead more: http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/product/rpg-maker-xp#ixzz1RfpSwXGO\n\n\nI created portable versions of the RMXP editor for those who want to use it on a computer that may not have it installed.  I compiled the editors, RTPs, libraries, and all necessary registry values into single executables.  They have no need for an install, and writes no data to the registry, since everything runs its own little sandbox.\n\nThe applications are trial versions, so you will need to insert the registration key generated by the included key generator.\n\nInstructions\nSimply click and run. There is no install, so it can be run from a USB device, or from wherever you like. If the PC does not have a file association set to the project file, you can either run the program and open it from that, or set the association to this application.\n\nKnown Bugs\nI have found that it sometimes generates an error on starting the application on 64-bit versions of Windows 7.  I haven't found a fix for this other than to continue to try and start it, which I have found after enough times, will start.  Other versions of Windows I have tested work fine.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc8d7644c53795c0d8b2e593ba22bd312cd8b34c","amp;dn":"RPG+Maker+XP+-+Portable+%28KeyGen+Inlcuded%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc8d7644c53795c0d8b2e593ba22bd312cd8b34c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,141,118,68,197,55,149,192,216,178,229,147,186,34,189,49,44,216,179,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
