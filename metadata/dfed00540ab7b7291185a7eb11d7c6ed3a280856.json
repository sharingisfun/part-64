Jack is initially reluctant to indulge Stone in the coarse banter he wishes to pursue and feels little sympathy for the prisoner's pleads for an early release. Seeing little hope in convincing Jack himself, Stone arranges for his wife Lucetta (Milla Jovovich) to seduce the officer, but motives and intentions steadily blur amidst the passions and buried secrets of the corrupted players in this deadly game of deception\n\nCAST:\nRobert De Niro as Jack Mabry, a correctional officer who is only weeks from retirement.[3]\nEdward Norton as Gerald &quot;Stone&quot; Creeson, a convicted arsonist trying to assure parole, by any means.[4]\nMilla Jovovich as Lucetta, Stone's wife.[4]\nFrances Conroy as Madylyn, Jack's wife.[\n\n\nDETAILS:\nEnglish\nIMDB: tt1423995\n105 Minutes\n\n\nPRODUCT DESCRIPTION: Academy AwardÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® winner Robert De Niro and OscarÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® nominee Edward Norton deliver powerful performances as a seasoned corrections official and a scheming inmate whose lives become dangerously intertwined in this ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgritty and engrossing thrillerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Steve OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Brien, WCBS-FM).
