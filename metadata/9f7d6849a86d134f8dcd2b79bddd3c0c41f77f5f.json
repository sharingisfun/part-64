Harbour,  Australia -  one of  the most  breathtakingly\n        beautiful  places  on earth.  It's  the setting  for  the Rock\n        Island Festival an annual three days of internationall  bands,\n        DJ's, sunshine and good  times. Food, music, romance,  million\n        -dollar views. Camping under the stars. Gorgeous young  people\n        from all over the world.\n\n        Twenty-four hours before the  festival begins, a deadly  virus\n        is discovered in Sydney.  The symptoms are shocking:  death is\n        swift and painful.\n\n        State  Health Emergency  co-ordinator Jim  Quinn believes  the\n        virus has found its perfect environment - on Rock Island.  Jim\n        is intelligent, honest  and courageous, and  therefore totally\n        out  of place  among the  appalling low-lifes  who govern  the\n        State. Jim is the first to understand the threat posed by  the\n        virus, and he's the  only person galvanised into  developing a\n        plan of action. But in the corridors of power, he is  isolated\n        and overruled. The  festival's a money  spinner for the  State\n        Government  and  they're not  about  to tell  Joe  Public that\n        there's a killer virus loose in their city. They'll fight  Jim\n        every step of the way.\n\n        Time is  running out.  People are  dying. Jim  battles to shut\n        down  the  festival  and  enforce  quarantine.  He  knows  his\n        daughter is on the island working as a police officer and then\n        discovers that his son has gone there too, in secret.\n\n        As the body  count on the  island begins to  rise, Jim becomes\n        desperate. He plays dirty, calls in the Army without authority\n        and teams up  with a maverick  colonel named Wilson  who knows\n        how to get things done.  But can Wilson be trusted?.  Suddenly\n        Sydney Harbour is a war zone and events spin out of control in\n        the Panic at Rock Island.\n\n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n              Viva Bianca            ....
