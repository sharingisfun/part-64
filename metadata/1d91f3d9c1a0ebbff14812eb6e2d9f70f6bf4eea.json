Not only do decisions affect your own life for good or ill, they can also affect the lives of your friends, your family, and your community.\n\nBut making a good decision and avoiding a horrible one is not a chance act. It's a skillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½one that can be learned, honed, and perfected. Mastering the art of critical decision making is the key to improving your life at home, at work, or in your community. When you understand the necessary components of a smart decision, you can examine mistakes you might have made in the past and sidestep potential mistakes in the future. And when you know the underlying psychological, social, and emotional components that influence decision makingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½whether they are your own decisions or the decisions of othersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½you can make sounder choices that produce better results.\n\nNow you can learn to approach the critical decisions in your life with a more seasoned, educated eye with The Art of Critical Decision Making, a fascinating 24-lecture course that explores how individuals, groups, and organizations make effective decisions and offers you tips and techniques to enhance the effectiveness of your own decision making. Taught by award-winning Professor Michael A. Roberto of Bryant UniversityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a scholar of leadership, managerial decision making, and business strategyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½this dynamic course is an engaging and practical guide to one of the most fundamental activities in your life.\n\nThree Levels of Decision Making\n\nThe heart of this accessible course is a thorough examination of decision making at three key levels.\n\nThe individual level: Studying how individuals make decisions reveals a wealth of insights into howÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and whyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½they make particular choices. Most individuals do not examine every possible alternative but instead draw on experience and rules of thumb. Most of us, it turns out, are susceptible to what psychologists call cognitive biases: decision traps that can cause us to make certain systematic mistakes when making choices. You also learn how intuition, surprisingly, is more than just a gut instinct and represents instead a powerful pattern recognition capability.\n\nThe group level: Because you don't always make choices on your own, it's important to understand decision making at the level of group or team. Here, you try to answer the question of whether groups are &quot;smarter&quot; and more capable of making critical decisions than individuals. The lectures show you problems that typically arise in group decision-making scenarios, including groupthink (the notorious tendency for groups to be pressured into conforming to a particular view) and a lack of synergy between team members. You also learn how groups can overcome these and other problems to make better decisions.\n\nThe organizational level: Studying decision making on the organizational level requires you to grasp how the structure, systems, and culture of a particular organization shape the behavior of its individual teams and members. Professor Roberto shows you how history's wrong decisions usually cannot be attributed to one wrong decision or poor leader. He also demonstrates how some organizations have encouraged and reliably performed vigilant decision making in the face of risky scenarios.\n\nThe Key to Effective Decision Making\n\nThe Art of Critical Decision Making reveals that bad decisions are usually made because of a poorly thought-out decision-making process. If decision makers put more emphasis on how to make a decision, ensure that they remove personal biases, collect information beforehand, glean the diverse perspectives of others, and perform a number of other constructive activities, they can vastly improve the strength and success of the process.\n\nProfessor Roberto employs the case method used by America's most prestigious business schools, including Harvard University. Designed to expose students to a breadth and depth of real-world examples and scenarios, the case method allows you to compare and contrast various situations as a way to recognize patterns. In doing so, you refine your ability to distinguish between smart and poor decision making.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d91f3d9c1a0ebbff14812eb6e2d9f70f6bf4eea","amp;dn":"TTC++Art+of+Critical+Decision+Making","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d91f3d9c1a0ebbff14812eb6e2d9f70f6bf4eea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,145,243,217,193,160,235,191,241,72,18,235,110,45,159,112,246,191,78,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
