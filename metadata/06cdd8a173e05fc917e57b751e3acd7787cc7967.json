Julian only thought about women. With neither really working out, the childhood best friends decide to start a detective agency. Unfortunately for them, on their first case they must help protect a sexy, high class escort who holds the key evidence to a scandalous cover up. The two bumbling detectives soon find themselves running from the mob, a corrupt US Senator, and a ruthless Mary Poppins-like assassin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ all of whom would stop at nothing to hide the truth. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just an average day for two bumbling losers.\n\nGenre: Action | Comedy\nIMDB rating: 5.2/10 from 524 users\nDirected by: John Stockwell\nStarring: Paz Vega, Janet McTeer and Christopher McDonald\n\nRelease Name: Cat.Run.2011.BDRiP.XViD-NOSCREENS\nSize: 701 MB\nVideo: XViD, 608ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€336, 780Kbps\nAudio: English , MP3 , 192 Kbps\nRuntime: 1 hour 42 mins \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06cdd8a173e05fc917e57b751e3acd7787cc7967","amp;dn":"Cat.Run.2011.BDRiP.XViD-NOSCREENS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06cdd8a173e05fc917e57b751e3acd7787cc7967","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,205,216,161,115,224,95,201,23,229,123,117,30,58,205,119,135,204,121,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
