By that standard, Jeff Chaz is one of the greatest living blues musicians today; he is on every level a master. Genius is a word that gets tossed about like old socks sometimes, but in this case the word is accurately descriptive of Jeff as a person ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ forget the musical talents. He is somewhat eccentric, disheveled (in an Einstein sort of way) and flamboyant but deeply spiritual, gracious, and kind. His amazing intellect is evident in his lyrics, derived of a life filled with experiences that rival any Deep South blues iconÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s painful past. He exudes brilliance as a melody writer, poignant instinct as a guitarist, and is a beautiful singer with tremendous range and a style of delivery that bends oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heartstrings. He is prolific in his ability to write, record, produce, and promote his music. His performances are nothing short of electrically stunning. He has written and produced 3 original albums and has many more projects that are fertile and awaiting naissance under the right circumstances.\n\n\nJeff Chaz (vocals, guitar); Douglas Potter (bass guitar); Fred Staehle (drums).\n\n\nIf you download this, open it, listen to it...then you will discover genius lurks within.\n   nightissuchproximity rates this dude as one of the best ever...\n...And I don't pass a comment such as that lightly...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:805399595f94a9a80aff26fc443e446227a89ed0","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Jeff+Chaz+-+In+Exile","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"805399595f94a9a80aff26fc443e446227a89ed0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,83,153,89,95,148,169,168,10,255,38,252,68,62,68,98,39,168,158,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
