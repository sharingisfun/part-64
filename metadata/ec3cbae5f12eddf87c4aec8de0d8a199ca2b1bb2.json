But every so often, a title comes along that does things a \n\nlittle bit differently. F.E.A.R. 3 is one such game. A horror and gore-inspired \nromp, \n\nF.E.A.R. 3 approaches the conventions of first-person shooters from a different \n\nperspective and successfully mixes together familiar gameplay elements with a unique \n\nand authentically chilling setting. F.E.A.R. 3 isn't without its problems, and these \n\nproblems stop it from being a top echelon shooter. Still, its tendency to go off the \n\nbeaten path is largely successful and will appeal to shooter fans and horror \n\naficionados alike.\n\n\nIn F.E.A.R. 3, gamers are placed in the role of the genetically-enhanced Point Man, \n\nthe protagonist from the original F.E.A.R. As you may remember from the end of \n\nF.E.A.R. 2, the mysterious female foil Alma forces herself upon that game's playable \n\ncharacter -- Becket -- and becomes pregnant with his child. Alma is an evil psychic \n\ndynamo manipulated by Armacham, the same company responsible for Point Man's genetic \n\nenhancement, but her powers far outweigh his own. Thus, stopping Alma from having \n\nthis kid is the name of the game in F.E.A.R. 3. Because after all, if Alma is so \n\npowerful, who knows what that kid is capable of?
