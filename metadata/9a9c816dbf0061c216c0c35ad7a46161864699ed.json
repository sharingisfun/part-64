Embracing the exaggerated pomp of prog rock and heavy metal, as well as vaudevillian music hall, the British quartet delved deeply into camp and bombast, creating a huge, mock-operatic sound with layered guitars and overdubbed vocals. Queen's music was a bizarre yet highly accessible fusion of the macho and the fey. For years, their albums boasted the motto &quot;no synthesizers were used on this record,&quot; signaling their allegiance with the legions of post-Led Zeppelin hard rock bands. But vocalist Freddie Mercury brought an extravagant sense of camp to Queen, pushing them toward kitschy humor and pseudo-classical arrangements, as epitomized on their best-known song, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody.&quot; Mercury, it must be said, was a flamboyant bisexual who managed to keep his sexuality in the closet until his death from AIDS in 1991. Through his legendary theatrical performances, Queen became one of the most popular bands in the world in the mid-'70s; in England, they remained second only to the Beatles in popularity and collectibility in the '90s. Despite their enormous popularity, Queen were never taken seriously by rock critics -- an infamous Rolling Stone review labeled their 1979 album Jazz as &quot;fascist.&quot; In spite of such harsh criticism, the band's popularity rarely waned; even in the late '80s, the group retained a fanatical following except in America. In the States, their popularity peaked in the early '80s, just as they finished nearly a decade's worth of extraordinarily popular records. And while those records were never praised, they sold in enormous numbers, and traces of Queen's music could be heard in several generations of hard rock and metal bands in the next two decades, from Metallica to Smashing Pumpkins.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.Death On Two Legs (Dedicated To...)\n02.Mustapha\n03.Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke\n04.Bring Back That Leroy Brown\n05.Seaside Rendezvous\n06.Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon\n07.The Millionaire Waltz\n08.Crazy Little Thing Called Love\n09.Dreamer's Ball\n10.Sleeping On The Sidewalk\n11.'39\n12.Fat Bottomed Girls\n13.Tie Your Mother Down\n14.Seven Seas Of Rhye\n15.Long Away\n16.All Dead, All Dead\n17.You And I\n18.Dead On Time\n19.Now I'm Here\n20.Sail Away Sweet Sister\n21.Leaving Home Ain't Easy\n22.White Queen (As It Began)\n23.You Take My Breath Away\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n\n01.It's A Beautiful Day\n02.Let Me Live\n03.My Love Is Dangerous\n04.I Can't Live With You\n05.My Life Has Been Saved\n06.There Must Be More To Life Than This\n07.In My Defence\n08.Too Much Love Will Kill You\n09.Ride The Wild Wind\n10.Mother Love\n11.Heaven For Everyone\n12.These Are The Days Of Our Lives\n13.One Year Of Love\n14.A Winter's Tale\n15.Don't Try So Hard\n16.Time\n17.Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow\n18.Barcelona\n19.Bijou\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a9c816dbf0061c216c0c35ad7a46161864699ed","amp;dn":"Queen+-+Greatest+Hits+II++2CD+%282007%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a9c816dbf0061c216c0c35ad7a46161864699ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,156,129,109,191,0,97,194,22,192,195,90,215,164,97,97,134,70,153,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
