Many mob-related bug fixes (and some new behaviors)\n\n2. Ocelots are easier to tame, and cats can be told to sit\n\n3. Many small bug fixes and tweaks\n\n4. Villagers will try to detect village houses and live in them\n\n5. Updated language files (now with 50% less profanities!)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe decided to do an extra update of the snapshot this week. The reason was because of \n\nthe shift-click bug when crafting items, which would consume all the items in the \n\ncrafting table and only produce a single result item. This bug is troublesome because \n\nit?s such a fundamental feature, and we don?t want to penalize people if they forget \n\nthat it?s broken.\n\nWe also fixed so that cats can be told to sit with an empty hand.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nINSTALL INTRUCTIONS \n\n\nWindows- \n\n1. Type %appdata% in the search bar \n\n2. .minecraft/bin\n\n3. change your current .jar file to whatever you like ( Example: minecraft1.1.jar )\n\n4. now just change the current .jar file that you downloaded to minecraft.jar\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nMAC - \n\n1. goto Finder/User/Library/Application Support/minecraft \n\n2. FOLLOW STEPS 2-4 above.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdc74493bfca55f0ca17928f7ee82aa1e47a2329","amp;dn":"Minecraft+1.2+%5B+Pre-release+3+%5D+-+JKoop+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdc74493bfca55f0ca17928f7ee82aa1e47a2329","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,199,68,147,191,202,85,240,202,23,146,143,126,232,42,161,228,122,35,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
