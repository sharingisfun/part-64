It is the first of six films released in the Star Wars saga: two subsequent films complete the original trilogy, while a prequel trilogy completes the six-film saga. It is the fourth film in terms of the series' internal chronology. Groundbreaking in its use of special effects, unconventional editing, and science fiction/fantasy storytelling, the original Star Wars is one of the most successful and influential films of all time.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/8441/starwarsivavisnapshot02.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/8441/starwarsivavisnapshot02.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img62.imageshack.us/img62/449/starwarsivavisnapshot07.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img62.imageshack.us/img62/449/starwarsivavisnapshot07.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img205.imageshack.us/img205/3954/starwarsivavisnapshot03.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img205.imageshack.us/img205/3954/starwarsivavisnapshot03.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img215.imageshack.us/img215/4963/starwarsivavisnapshot05.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img215.imageshack.us/img215/4963/starwarsivavisnapshot05.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe galaxy is in a state of civil war. Spies for the Rebel Alliance have stolen plans to the Galactic Empire's Death Star, a weaponized space station capable of annihilating an entire planet. Rebel leader Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is in possession of the plans, but her ship is captured by Imperial forces under the command of the evil lord Darth Vader (David Prowse). Before she is captured, Leia hides the plans in the memory of a droid called R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), along with a holographic recording. The small droid escapes to the surface of the desert planet Tatooine with fellow droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels).\n\nThe droids are quickly captured by Jawa traders, who sell the pair to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars (Phil Brown and Shelagh Fraser) and their nephew, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). While Luke is cleaning R2-D2, he accidentally triggers part of Leia's holographic message, in which she requests help from Obi-Wan Kenobi. The only &quot;Kenobi&quot; Luke knows of is an old hermit named Ben Kenobi (Alec Guiness) who lives in the nearby hills. The next morning, upon finding R2-D2 after he escapes to seek Obi-Wan, Luke meets Ben Kenobi, revealing himself to be Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan tells Luke of his days as a Jedi Knight, one of a faction of former galactic peacekeepers who were wiped out by the Empire. Contrary to his uncle's claims, Luke learns that his father Anakin Skywalker fought alongside Obi-Wan as a Jedi Knight before he was betrayed and killed by Vader, Obi-Wan's former pupil who turned to the &quot;dark side of the Force&quot;.\n\nObi-Wan views Leia's complete message in which she begs Obi-Wan to take the Death Star plans to her home planet of Alderaan for her father to retrieve and analyze. He then asks Luke to accompany him and learn the ways of the Force. Luke initially refuses, but changes his mind after discovering that Imperial stormtroopers have destroyed his home and killed his aunt and uncle in search of C-3PO and R2-D2. Obi-Wan and Luke hire smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) to transport them on their ship, the Millennium Falcon.................\n\n\n\n\nirected by George Lucas\nProduced by Gary Kurtz\nWritten by George Lucas\nStarring Mark Hamill\nHarrison Ford\nCarrie Fisher\nPeter Cushing\nAlec Guinness\nMusic by John Williams\nCinematography Gilbert Taylor, BSC\nEditing by Richard Chew\nPaul Hirsch\nMarcia Lucas\nStudio Lucasfilm\nDistributed by 20th Century Fox\n\n\n\n\n[b]Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker: Luke is a young man who was raised by his aunt and uncle on the remote, desert world Tatooine.
