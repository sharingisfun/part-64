He offers rewards for the death of Grendel, so Beowulf, a great and boastful Geat warrior, arrives with his thanes. Beowulf sets aside his armor and awaits the monster; a fierce battle ensues that leads to Beowolf's entering the watery lair of Grendel's mother, where a devil's bargain awaits. Beowulf returns to Herot, the castle, and becomes king. Jump ahead many years, and the sins of the father are visited upon Beowulf and his kingdom. The hero must face his weakness and be heroic once again. Is the age of demons over?\n\n\nEnglish subs included in torrent\n\n\nPlease do not hit and run...seed so others may enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de243514bb54eaa1477889698d66bb141878a944","amp;dn":"Beowulf+Directors+Cut+%282007%29+%5Beng+subs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de243514bb54eaa1477889698d66bb141878a944","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,36,53,20,187,84,234,161,71,120,137,105,141,102,187,20,24,120,169,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
