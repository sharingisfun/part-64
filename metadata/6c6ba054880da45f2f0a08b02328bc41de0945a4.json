It follows the story of con artist Frank Abagnale, Jr. A majority of the plot is borrowed from the 2002 film of the same name, which in turn was based on Abagnale\\'s 1980 autobiography.\n \nAfter a tryout in Seattle in 2009, Catch Me If You Can opened at Broadway\\'s Neil Simon Theatre in April 2011. The production received four Tony Awards nominations, including one for Best Musical, winning Best Actor in a Musical for Norbert Leo Butz.\n\n1.  Live in Living Color   \n2.
