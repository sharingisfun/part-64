But it may surprise many to learn that nearly 95 percent of all cases resulting in felony convictions never reach a jury. Instead, they are settled through plea bargains in which a defendant agrees to plead guilty in exchange for a reduced sentence.\n\n&quot;The real American justice system is unlike anything depicted on Law &amp; Order and Court TV,&quot; says producer Ofra Bikel. &quot;I know I was stunned when I realized that only about 5 percent of all felony convictions result from jury trials. The rest are settled by plea bargains. And these deals aren't always to the defendant's advantage.&quot;\n\n&quot;The Plea&quot; tells several stories -- different people, different charges, different parts of the country, all with one thing in common: the difficult dilemma of confronting a plea. The program also interviews experts on the criminal justice system.\n\t\n&quot;The Plea&quot; is Ofra Bikel's latest investigation into America's criminal justice system. Her previous reports include &quot;The Burden of Innocence,&quot; &quot;Requiem for Frank Lee Smith,&quot; &quot;An Ordinary Crime,&quot; &quot;The Case for Innocence,&quot; &quot;Snitch,&quot; and the trilogy of programs entitled &quot;Innocence Lost&quot;....\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/plea/etc/synopsis.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/plea/etc/synopsis.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:426085bf3e641418db99b12a6884d01e35d2100b","amp;dn":"PBS+Frontline+-+The+Plea+%282004%29+DVDrip.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"426085bf3e641418db99b12a6884d01e35d2100b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,96,133,191,62,100,20,24,219,153,177,42,104,132,208,30,53,210,16,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
