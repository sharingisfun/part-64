Flag of Hope \n12. Some Kind of Hero \n13. Lullaby \n\nThe songs of David Roth stimulate all of the listenerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s senses... His clear and soulful voice conveys so much emotion that it can be frightening, at first ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ such is the intensity that he projects. Every word is carefully formed and sounds absolutely unique. The stories he sings reveal themselves as reality. David Roth has not invented these stories, and why should he? \n\nThe songs of David Roth appear at first to be harmless, but every word counts: &quot;John &amp; Josie&quot; describes an experience that makes it crystal clear that things are not always as they appear. &quot;That Kind of Grace&quot; is an exemplary portrayal of the all-pervading violence in todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s society. And then there are the very personal songs that allow the listener to discover almost forgotten memories, - brought to life through the imagery of the lyrics. David Roth is an observer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ one with a keen and honest eye. He speaks to the listenerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s intellect via the heart. \n\nProducer GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼nter Pauler describes his first encounter with the singer-songwriter: &quot;I was amazed at the surety, with which David Roth turns such diverse themes as the career of a basketball player and the closing of a bakery into works of art. It would unfortunately be two years before our working schedules would coincide and this album could be recorded.&quot; \n\nDavid Roth was born in Chicago and lives on Cape Cod ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a domicile for musicians and artists, a slightly different America. He has already released 6 CDs in the US ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ for his Stockfisch debut, he made his way to the Stockfisch studio in Northeim, Germany and recorded 12 wonderful songs and one instrumental piece. An outstanding album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ intelligent, poetic and very emotional. \n\nRecording Equipment Used: \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ B&amp;W Nautilus 801 monitor speakers ferromag mains-filter cable \n\nMusicians: \nDavid Roth - vocals, guitars, triple ocarina \nChris Jones - guitars \nHans-JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rg Maucksch - fretless bass \nHrolfur Vagnsson - accordion \nThomas Klippel - Hammond B3 \nChristina Lux - backing vocals \nChristiane Eiben - backing vocals \nChristine Maringer-Tries - backing vocals \nBeo Brockhausen - accordion, saxophone, gu-zheng, sarod, flutes, santuruillean pipe chanter \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d36796a856907b81f60efcf868364beeae4e156","amp;dn":"David+Roth...Pearl+Diver%282004%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d36796a856907b81f60efcf868364beeae4e156","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,54,121,106,133,105,7,184,31,96,239,207,134,131,100,190,234,228,225,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
