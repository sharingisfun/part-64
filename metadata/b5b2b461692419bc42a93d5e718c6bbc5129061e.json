Desperate for answers, Rose takes Sharon to Silent Hill. As they approach the town, she is pursued by police officer Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden). A child appears in the middle of the road, causing Rose to swerve and crash the car, knocking herself unconscious. When she awakens, Sharon is nowhere to be seen, and fog and falling ash blanket the town.\nRose wanders the empty streets of Silent Hill looking for her daughter and instead encounters various monsters which appear after sirens wail. Rose comes across a woman named Dahlia Gillespie (Deborah Kara Unger) who speaks of terrible things done to her own daughter, Alessa, by the townspeople. She claims that Sharon is Alessa. Rose returns to her car and runs into Cybil, who arrests her. After they discover that the road leading out of town has disappeared they pair up to search the town.\nMeanwhile, Christopher also simultaneously scours the town, which is shown to be abandoned and without the mist and falling ash, with the reluctant assistance of Officer Thomas Gucci (Kim Coates), who grew up in the town. Christopher discovers documents showing that the town was abandoned after a coal seam fire thirty years before, along with a photo of Dahlia's daughter who bears a remarkable resemblance to Sharon. Told to stop investigating under threat of incarceration, he reluctantly heads home.\nRose and Cybil meet a woman named Anna (Tanya Allen), who leads them to the town church for refuge. A siren blares as they approach the building, and Anna is killed by the monster Pyramid Head (Roberto Campanella). In the church, Rose and Cybil discover a cult, headed by Christabella (Alice Krige). Christabella tells Rose about &quot;the demon&quot;, who knows where Sharon is. After convincing Christabella to help them find &quot;the demon&quot; so feared by the townspeople, Rose and Cybil are taken to the town hospital. There, Christabella learns of the likeness between Sharon and Alessa, and condemns Rose and Cybil as witches. Cybil allows herself to be captured and beaten by the townspeople in order for Rose to escape and descend into the hospital basement. There, Rose encounters the badly burned Alessa in a hospital bed and a mysterious being in the form of a little girl who strongly resembles the missing Sharon.\nIn a flashback, Rose discovers that Silent Hill had a long history of witch burnings, stemming from the beliefs of the cult. Thirty years prior to Rose's arrival, Alessa was stigmatized for having been born out of wedlock by an unknown father (who is suggested to be of supernatural origin, a classic Lovecraftian device). Her schoolmates bullied her, while the adults made no effort to protect her. During her time at school, Alessa was implied to be raped by the school's janitor, Colin, who was later found dead and bound by barbed wire by Rose in the same toilets in which the abuse happened. Dahlia agreed to Christabella's suggestion that she allow the cult to 'restore the innocence' in Alessa. When not allowed to follow Alessa into the ritual, Dahlia realized that they intended to kill her daughter and ran to the police. Alessa was subjected to a ritual burning, but in the midst of the ritual, the cage by which she was suspended swung, dumping the coals and causing a fire. When Dahlia returned with the police, Alessa was horribly burned but still alive. While in the hospital, Alessa's pain and rage caused her dark side to manifest in the form of a double of Alessa, who refers to herself as the darkness inside Alessa. Alessa then pulled the townspeople into a world of dark dreams, corrupted by the injuries that were inflicted on her body.[8] Rose learns that Sharon is the manifestation of Alessa's remaining innocence and goodness. After the flashback, Rose is told that she must aid Alessa in her revenge by granting her entry into the church; she is also told that Christabella will soon find the real Sharon and attempt to burn her as well.\nRose enters the church after Cybil has already been burned to death by the townspeople, and Sharon is about to suffer a similar fate. She confronts Christabella with her knowledge of the truth, attempting to convince the cult that they are in denial of their own fate. Christabella stabs Rose, causing her blood to drip onto the church floor. The blood serves as a portal, and Alessa rises out of a pit and proceeds to kill Christabella and the townspeople with tendrils of barbed wire, leaving Dahlia, Rose, and Sharon the only survivors.\nRose and Sharon leave Silent Hill and return home. Though Rose and Sharon are in the same room as Christopher, who has also returned home, they cannot see each other.\n\n\n\n\nINFO\n\nGeneral\n\nName : Silent Hill.mkv\nFormato : Matroska\nDimensione : 11,4 GiB\nDurata : 2h 5min\nBitRate totale : 13,0 Mbps\nData di codifica : UTC 2009-10-06 23:37:19\nCreato con : mkvmerge v2.9.5 ('Tu es le seul') built on Jun 7 2009 11:07:07\nCompressore : libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormato : AVC\nFormato/Informazioni : Advanced Video Codec\nProfilo del formato : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;024a6b656a424e362c33&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nImpostazioni del formato, CABAC : Si\nImpostazioni del formato, ReFram : 4 fotogrammi\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDurata : 2h 5min\nBitRate : 10,7 Mbps\nLarghezza : 1 920 pixel\nAltezza : 816 pixel\nAspectRatio : 2,35:1\nFrameRate : 23,976 fps\nColorSpace : YUV\nChromaSubsampling : 4:2:0\nBitDepth/String : 8 bits\nTipo di scansione : Progressivo\nBit/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.286\nDimensione della traccia : 9,42 GiB (83%)\nTitolo : x264 - crf encode\nCompressore : x264 core 67 r1125M 10d6ef0\nImpostazioni compressione : cabac=1 / ref=4 / deblock=1:-2:-2 / analyse=0x3:0x113 / me=umh / subme=7 / psy_rd=1.1:0.0 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=24 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=2 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / nr=0 / decimate=0 / mbaff=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=0 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=3 / wpredb=1 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / rc=crf / crf=21.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / vbv_maxrate=38000 / vbv_bufsize=30000 / ip_ratio=1.40 / pb_ratio=1.30 / aq=1:1.00\nLingua : Inglese\n\nAudio #1\nID : 2\nFormato : AC-3\nFormato/Informazioni : Audio Coding 3\nFormat_Settings_ModeExtension : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID : A_AC3\nDurata : 2h 5min\nModalitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  : Costante\nBitRate : 448 Kbps\nCanali : 6 canali\nPosizione dei canali : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSamplingRate : 48,0 KHz\nBitDepth/String : 16 bits\nRitardo video : 27ms\nDimensione della traccia : 403 Mb (3%)\nTitolo : DD 5.1 (448 Kbps)\nLingua : Italiano\n\nAudio #2\nID : 3\nFormato : DTS\nFormato/Informazioni : Digital Theater Systems\nCodec ID : A_DTS\nDurata : 2h 5min\nModalitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  : Costante\nBitRate : 1 510 Kbps\nCanali : 6 canali\nPosizione dei canali : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSamplingRate : 48,0 KHz\nBitDepth/String : 24 bits\nDimensione della traccia : 1,33 GiB (12%)\nTitolo : DTS - 1536 kbit/sec\nLingua : Inglese\n\nTesto #1\nID : 4\nFormato : UTF-8\nCodec ID : S_TEXT/UTF8\nCodec ID/Informazioni : UTF-8 Plain Text\nLingua : Italiano\n\nTesto #2\nID : 5\nFormato : UTF-8\nCodec ID : S_TEXT/UTF8\nCodec ID/Informazioni : UTF-8 Plain Text\nTitolo : forced\nLingua : Italiano\n\nTesto #3\nID : 6\nFormato : UTF-8\nCodec ID : S_TEXT/UTF8\nCodec ID/Informazioni : UTF-8 Plain Text\nLingua : Inglese\n\nTesto #4\nID : 7\nFormato : UTF-8\nCodec ID : S_TEXT/UTF8\nCodec ID/Informazioni : UTF-8 Plain Text\nLingua : Olandese\n\n\nENJOY ALL","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5b2b461692419bc42a93d5e718c6bbc5129061e","amp;dn":"Silent+Hill+%28Gans+2006%29%2C+%5BBDrip+1080p+-+H264+-+Ac3+Ita+Dts+Eng+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5b2b461692419bc42a93d5e718c6bbc5129061e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,178,180,97,105,36,25,188,66,169,61,94,113,140,107,188,81,41,6,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
