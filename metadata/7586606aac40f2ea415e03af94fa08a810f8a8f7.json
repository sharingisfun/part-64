I was ready to jump the\nmark and call this out to be one of her strongest record to date but\ndespite being touted as her most varied album in years, some of the\nmaterial here seem rather hit and miss.\n\nSonically, The Sea has come together as a compilation that plays to\nMelanieÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strengths and everything weÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve liked from her solo\ndiscography. ThereÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s meant to be a winning combination of ballads,\nmodern dance/pop and her signature spunky rock sound Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â€œ a deliberate\nthrowback to her Northern Star debut which spawned mega hits like Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ËœI\nTurn To YouÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ËœNever Be The Same AgainÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7586606aac40f2ea415e03af94fa08a810f8a8f7","amp;dn":"Melanie_C_-_The_Sea-2011-MOD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7586606aac40f2ea415e03af94fa08a810f8a8f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,134,96,106,172,64,242,234,65,94,3,175,148,250,8,168,16,248,168,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
