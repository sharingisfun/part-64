This is an &quot;iPod H.264&quot; video file of the astonishing, hilarious television show from Nickelodeon called, &quot;iCarly&quot;. \nThis video file is the very first episode of iCarly, which is why the episode is called &quot;iPilot&quot;.\nThis first episode is eventually made in Season 1 and you can directly sync this to your portable device, &quot;iPod Nano&quot;, but I'm not sure for other devices, so I prefer you to try syncing this video file to your other devices other than iPod Nano to see if it really works. \nThis is my first time uploading a video to &quot;ThePirateBay&quot;. I created this torrent from uTorrent and started to seed it. \nIf you are having some critical issues with this file, please tell me them so I can fix it. Please seed this video file and I would be uploading more files soon! \n\nBy Windows10,\nCreated on February 9, 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5265ab6f7f2510b50aec451da4dad289afeadaf2","amp;dn":"iCarly+Season+1%3A+Episode+1+%26quot%3BiPilot%26quot%3B+%28iPod+H.264%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5265ab6f7f2510b50aec451da4dad289afeadaf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,101,171,111,127,37,16,181,10,236,69,29,164,218,210,137,175,234,218,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
