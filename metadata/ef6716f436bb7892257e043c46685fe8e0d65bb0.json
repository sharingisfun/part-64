One psycho with a .45 controlled them, making them cast a single six sided dice &quot;die&quot; to choose the fate of the other. Will the dose be fatal or not? Some lived, some died.

A Hispanic woman detective was trying to prove that her father wasn't a suicide but was murdered.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1465478/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1465478/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef6716f436bb7892257e043c46685fe8e0d65bb0","amp;dn":"Die+%282010%29+%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef6716f436bb7892257e043c46685fe8e0d65bb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,103,22,244,54,187,120,146,37,126,4,60,70,104,95,232,224,214,91,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
