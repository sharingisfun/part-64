Their musical influences however, are mainly from British bands like New Order, The Cure, The Smiths, and The Beatles.\n\nIn 1996 Suzie Kerstgens, Tom Deininger and Sten Servaes founded the band Ralley, but an accident forced them to take a break and reform as Klee in 2002. The name was inspired (according to Suzie Kerstgens) by the work of Paul Klee, and also refers to the four leaf clover as a good luck symbol.\n\nAs KLEE they released their first CD ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnverwundbarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in 2002 with the respectable Club-Hits ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œErinner DichÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLichtstrahlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Their second outcome was ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJelÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ngerjelieberÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with their so far biggest chart-success ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGoldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ2 FragenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which became the theme for the campaign ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDie GesellschafterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by the German association ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAktion MenschÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. After playing about 150 concerts in 2004 and 2005, presenting ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGoldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in the TV-Show ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBundesvision SongcontestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, supporting Nena on her tour, and releasing their second Album in the USA (under the name ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHoneysuckleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, with three exclusive tracks in English language) they released their third album on 04. August 2006: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œZwischen Himmel und ErdeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which entered the German Album-Charts on a sensational 17th rank!
