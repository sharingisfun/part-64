Born To Run\n\n\nNotes:\nSimilar to the recent February 5, 1975, Main Point disc 2 upgrade, here is another upgrade of the second half of a show.  This time, it\\\\\\'s the final show of the second short tour of 1976, from the Palladium in New York City on November 4.\n\nThis show had been available from a soundboard source basically forever, but with a source change in Jungleland, there\\\\\\'s a noticeable drop in quality.  This new source -- also a soundboard -- is able to upgrade the sound from Rosalita through the end of the show (meaning there\\\\\\'s still a source change in Jungleland).\n\nFor the first two songs (and the Bomb Scare Announcement), we used the KBMKeefer release \\\\\\&quot;Streak of Light Through the Tunnel,\\\\\\&quot; which had previously been the best version of this show.\n\nUnfortunately, the new source was missing about 33 seconds in the middle of Sandy, so the \\\\\\&quot;Streak of Light\\\\\\&quot; source was used to complete the song (starting with the \\\\\\&quot;I spoke to them last night\\\\\\&quot; line and going until the \\\\\\&quot;Madam Marie\\\\\\&quot; line).\n\nThis second part of the show is highlighted by Ronnie Spector\\\\\\'s guest appearance on three songs from the Ronettes, as well as the one and only Springsteen performance of the Animals\\\\\\' \\\\\\&quot;We Gotta Get Out of This Place.\\\\\\&quot;\n\nMore upgrades are indeed on the way, so stay tuned.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b81948388334c69990027d5050e766757ef5579","amp;dn":"1976-11-04+-+The+Palladium+-+New+York%2C+NY+-+SBD+-+JEMS+-+Disc+2+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b81948388334c69990027d5050e766757ef5579","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,129,148,131,136,51,76,105,153,0,39,213,5,14,118,103,87,239,85,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
