Includes The Celebrity Game, Beat The Clock, Name That Tune, Masquerade Party, and Do You Trust Your Wife. You can't help but get nostalgic watching this. Truly entertaining as well. Highlights for me are the Do You Trust Your Wife with Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd. Very funny!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03f2736dbe49b0741736a770f63284bc50e8507d","amp;dn":"6+Classic+50%5C%27s+%26+60%5C%27s+Game+Shows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03f2736dbe49b0741736a770f63284bc50e8507d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,242,115,109,190,73,176,116,23,54,167,112,246,50,132,188,80,232,80,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
