This prompts him to begin therapy with Dr. Jennifer Melfi. Gradually, the storyline reveals details of Tony's upbringing, with his father's influence looming large on his development as a gangster, but more so that Tony's mother, Livia, was vengeful and possibly personality-disordered. His complicated relationship with his wife Carmela is also explored, as well as her feelings regarding her husband's cosa nostra ties. Meadow and Anthony Jr., Tony's children gain increasing knowledge of their father's mob dealings. Later, federal indictments are brought as a result of someone in his organization talking to the FBI and his own Uncle plots Tony's death.\n\nAfter ordering the execution of Brendan Filone and the mock execution of Chris Moltisanti, Tony's Uncle Junior is installed as boss of the family (following the death of previous boss Jackie Aprile, Sr. from cancer), even though Tony actually controls most things from behind the scenes. Furious at Junior's plan to have him killed, Tony responds to the attempt on his life with a violent reprisal and confronts his mother for her role in plotting his downfall. She has a psychologically triggered pseudo-stroke and Junior is arrested by the FBI on non-related charges.\n \nFile: .mov\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0705224/\n\nYear: 1999\n\nGenre: Crime / Drama \n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                   : QuickTime\nCodec ID                         : qt  \nFile size                        : 2.15 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 0mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 5 133 Kbps\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2011-08-05 11:51:36\nTagged date                      : UTC 2011-08-05 11:51:36\nWriting application              : Lavf51.12.1\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : 20\nDuration                         : 1h 0mn\nBit rate                         : 4 999 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                           : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                  : Constant\nFrame rate                       : 47.952 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.113\nStream size                      : 2.10 GiB (97%)\nWriting library                  : Lavc51.40.4\nLanguage                         : English\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2011-08-05 11:51:36\nTagged date                      : UTC 2011-08-05 11:51:36\n\nAudio\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                   : LC\nCodec ID                         : 40\nDuration                         : 1h 0mn\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 55.0 MiB (2%)\nLanguage                         : English\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2011-08-05 11:51:36\nTagged date                      : UTC 2011-08-05 11:51:36\n\nScreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/1787/vlcsnap2011080613h40m58u.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/1787/vlcsnap2011080613h40m58u.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img641.imageshack.us/img641/8628/vlcsnap2011080613h41m46.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img641.imageshack.us/img641/8628/vlcsnap2011080613h41m46.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img687.imageshack.us/img687/6348/vlcsnap2011080613h45m46.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img687.imageshack.us/img687/6348/vlcsnap2011080613h45m46.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis is 720p optimized for the XBox\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86f91434317afd3e3a871d681e63fe886d091574","amp;dn":"The+Sopranos+Season+1+-+720p+HD+-+Optimized+for+XBox","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86f91434317afd3e3a871d681e63fe886d091574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,249,20,52,49,122,253,62,58,135,29,104,30,99,254,136,109,9,21,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
