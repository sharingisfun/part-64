At this point take note the russian dvd audio's channel order is wrong. C is fr and vice versa so had to correct the channel order, cleaned faint hints of russian from the rear surround channels then replaced the FL and FR channels with the channels from the cleaned, synced and fixed cam audio, then encoded this to aften ac3 to give full multichannel audio with a combination of studio and cam audio. Dont be fooled by all this. The end result is an excellent high quality file. The carlsberg of all jobs lol. Enjoy another fine kingdom release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fab6d52b0e39a5493f7aaaa34b78987a13790c3a","amp;dn":"Zookeeper+2011+R5+READNFO+x264+AAC-DiNGiE%28Kingdom-Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fab6d52b0e39a5493f7aaaa34b78987a13790c3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,182,213,43,14,57,165,73,63,122,170,163,75,120,152,122,19,121,12,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
