For the deeper thinkers, we have the Ludwig von Mises Institute:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mises.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mises.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI recommend checking out a story or two first in the Blog section, then checking out the Media and Literature sections, where you'll find the very best mineable trove of videos, audio downloads, short and long format articles, and whole libertarian masterworks available for sale in print or downloadable as free PDFs. \n\nThere is also a rich community of followers and contributors in the Community section. Here there is plenty of opportunity to engage in thoughtful and earnest debate with considerate people. The difference in perspectives expressed there will help you discover if you really think you know your own positions, or if you might have been &quot;programmed&quot; with doubtful information.\n\nSpend some time steeping in the culture of this site, and you won't think about politics and economics in the same ways again.\n\nThat's plenty of homework.
