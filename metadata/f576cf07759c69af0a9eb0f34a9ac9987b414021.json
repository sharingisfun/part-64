Tim, who had scoffed at Nick's idea and passed on an opportunity to get in on the deal, can only watch as Nick's fortune -- and Tim's own envy -- grow to equally outrageous proportions. When the flames of jealousy are fanned by an oddball drifter (Walken) who imposes himself into the situation, Tim's life careens wildly out of control ... taking Nick's with it. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0326856/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0326856/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f576cf07759c69af0a9eb0f34a9ac9987b414021","amp;dn":"Envy-DvdRip-2004","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f576cf07759c69af0a9eb0f34a9ac9987b414021","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,118,207,7,117,156,105,175,10,158,176,243,74,154,201,152,123,65,64,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
