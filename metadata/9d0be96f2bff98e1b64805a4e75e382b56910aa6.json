Astera and I had a conversation that went something like this:\n\nB: There should be a book.\nA: Yes, there should.\nB: We have 12 days.\nA: We can do it.\n\nThe twelve days we had was until CCC started. We figured we would have it done by then. We contacted all the hackers we knew around the world and put the word out. We expected to get about a half a page of writing from each space. We reckoned that it would be a 25 page pamphlet. We also reckoned that it be easy for folks to write up a little summary within a few days of what it was like to get their hackerspace started and get back to us.\n\nWithin a week we had been scorched by a flame war, gotten a lot of both written and photographic material submitted and it seemed likely that the book would happen. Then the submissions kept comingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and coming. The hackerspaces around the world told each other about the project and many groups sent some writing in describing the beginning of their hackerspace. Word had even gotten round to groups that didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have a space yet and they were sending us descriptions of their pre-beginnings too!\n\nThe 12 days came and went and still the submissions kept coming. After a few months submissions had trailed off and Astera came to NYC and began designing the book. SheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a pro and it shows. This book looks beautiful because she took the material and somehow made it fit together aesthetically, not a trivial task. Jens Ohlig jumped into the process last year to help push the editing process forward. Remember, in our minds it was going to be a project that would take less than two weeks and it turned into something epic. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been a long wait and I hope youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll think that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worth it.\n\nDownload HackerSpaces: The Beginning!\n\nThis book documents where the hackerspace movement was in December of 2008. In that way itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a bit of a time capsule. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not an exhaustive book, but we hope there are enough stories in here to show that all your excuses for not starting up a hackerspace are invalid. Each group faced down their own dragons to bring their hackerspace into existence including  floods, rats, and drama. If they can do it, so can you.\n\nWe did this because we wanted it to exist and so it is a reward in itself. If you feel moved and want to support hackerspaces, we suggest contributing to the Wau Holland fund which helps make awesome things happen for hackerspaces. We would also like to thank everyone who submitted photographs and writing, this is your book.\n\nAfter these years, the book is finally free in the world as a pdf. Download it, read it, and share it. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re open to the idea of making it into a real physical book and if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re interested in making that happen, let us know.\n\nBuild, Unite, Multiply!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://blog.hackerspaces.org/2011/08/31/hackerspaces-the-beginning-the-book/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://blog.hackerspaces.org/2011/08/31/hackerspaces-the-beginning-the-book/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d0be96f2bff98e1b64805a4e75e382b56910aa6","amp;dn":"Hackerspaces+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+The+Beginning+%28the+book%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d0be96f2bff98e1b64805a4e75e382b56910aa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,11,233,111,43,255,152,225,182,72,5,164,231,94,56,43,86,145,10,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
