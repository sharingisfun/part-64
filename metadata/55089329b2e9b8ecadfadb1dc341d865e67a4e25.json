It is nearly impossible to find torrent files that include all the extras or even important commentaries.\nThese files are from my collection of DVDs that I have made from rented movies over the last seven years or so.\nNearly all of them have been put onto a DVD5, so unfortunately I do not have an uncompressed source handy.  That said I can assure you that these look GREAT on larger screens.\nI chose to make them this size for economy as DVD9s were $3 each when I started this and DVD5s were .25 cents each.\nNow I am working on putting some of the best ones on a hard drive to be played with my HD TV Media Player and am still thinking economy is the best rule as these are half the size of ripping a DVD9.\nThis is the best quality for the value.\n\nI would love some productive feedback  . . .   :)\n\nThis is a DVD rip to an ISO so you can watch it on your media player, mount it to a virtual drive or burn it to a DVD.\n\nThis file includes EVERYTHING the original DVD has:\n\n1961\n91 minutes\nBlack and White\n1.33:1\nSpoken Language: Swedish and English Dubbed\nSubtitles: English\nExploring the film: Video discussion with Ingmar Bergman biographer Peter Cowie\nOriginal theatrical trailer\nOptional English-dubbed soundtrack\nNew and improved English subtitle translation\n\nAwards:\n1962 Academy Award \nBest Foreign Language Film \n\n1963 Academy Award  \nBest Writing Original Screenplay nominee \n\n1963 BAFTA  \nBest Film nominee\nBest Actress nominee: Harriet Andersson \n\nSYNOPSIS:  \nIngmar Bergman directs.\nWhile vacationing on a remote island retreat, a familyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s already fragile ties are tested when daughter Karin (Harriet Andersson) discovers her father has been using her schizophrenia for his own literary means. As she drifts in and out of lucidity, the father (Gunnar Bjornstrand), along with KarinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s husband (Max von Sydow) and her younger brother (Lars Passgard) are unable to prevent KarinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s harrowing descent into the abyss of mental illness. Winner of the 1962 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and featuring an astonishing lead performance by Andersson, Through a Glass Darkly presents an unflinching vision of a familyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s near disintegration and a tortured psyche further taunted by GodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s intangible presence.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55089329b2e9b8ecadfadb1dc341d865e67a4e25","amp;dn":"Through+a+Glass+Darkly+%281961%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55089329b2e9b8ecadfadb1dc341d865e67a4e25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,8,147,41,178,233,184,236,173,250,219,29,195,65,216,101,230,122,78,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
