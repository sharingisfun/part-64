Everyone needs to get this information.   This is a collection of torrents with educational material on what is going on and how your freedom is in extreme jeopardy.   Cell-phone like technology is now being implanted into people\\\\\\'s brains without their knowledge or consent which allows the encoding and decoding of brainwaves, which are then modulated and transmitted over a wireless link.   The remote station processes the signals and can decode your visual and auditory senses, thoughts, and other neurological and biological data in real-time.   \n\nWhen you are chipped like this and they can read your every though, you are totally owned.   This is happening everywhere right now and it is totally covert, yet easily the greatest human rights violation of all time.
