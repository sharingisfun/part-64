Set on automatic modes, cameras typically attempt to reduce or eliminate blur in a picture. But by manipulating shutter speed creatively, photographers can achieve a range of striking motion blur or stop-action effects. Using an array of inspiring photographs depicting people, wildlife, and landscapes, Creative Power of Shutter Speed explains how to &quot;read&quot; the light and movement in a potential photograph and identify the best shutter speed for the desired effect.\nFrom the Back Cover\nLearn to unleash the power of every shutter speed\n\nShutter speed is an integral part of exposure. Learn to use it creatively, and you unlock the magic that transforms an ordinary subject into a work of art. From the blazing 1/8000 second that captures each feather in a hummingbird's wing to the lazy half-second that turns a fireworks display into a color-rich patchwork, shutter speed allows you to freeze time. Derek Doeffinger teaches you to harness the power that separates the amateur from the professional.\n\n    * Unleash the power of shutter speed from 1/8000 second to 8 hours\n    *\n\n      Learn creative techniques to transform your photos\n    *\n\n      Discover how to achieve different effects with various aperture/shutter speed combinations\n    *\n\n      Determine the effect of weather and lighting conditions\n    *\n\n      Use filters, lenses, tripods, and other tools to manipulate shutter speed\n    *\n\n      Explore stop-action and creative blur techniques\n    *\n\n      See how to reinforce your creative vision using Photoshop\n    *\n\n      View what you can achieve in stunning full-color examples\n\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 272 pages\n    * Publisher: Wiley; 1 edition (August 10, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0470453621\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0470453629","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fef699b939b3bf7b4da60d45e3ed995659aa70e3","amp;dn":"Creative+Shutter+Speed%3A+Master+the+Art+of+Motion+Capture+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fef699b939b3bf7b4da60d45e3ed995659aa70e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,246,153,185,57,179,191,123,77,166,13,69,227,237,153,86,89,170,112,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
