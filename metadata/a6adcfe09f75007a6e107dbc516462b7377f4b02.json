Private pilots, commercial organizations, militaries and academia rely on Prepar3D for immersive, experiential learning.\n\nPrepar3D (pronounced ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpreparedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) is a visual simulation platform that allows users to create training scenarios across aviation, maritime and ground domains. Users can train anywhere in the virtual world, from under water to sub orbital space.\n\nPrepar3D furthers the development of MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® ESPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ while maintaining compatibility with Microsoft Flight Simulator X, allowing many thousands of add-ons to be used within Prepar3D.\n\nGo to the Experience page to see videos and screenshots of Prepar3D in action!\n\n\nFeatures\n\n    High-detail living world with 45 airports and 39 cities\n    Environment includes highway, air and maritime vehicles and traffic, as well as livestock and wild animals\n    Customizable, data driven graphics and models\n    Whole earth WGS-84 model\n    Accurate topography with regionally and culturally appropriate textures\n    Modifiable real-time weather system, continuous time of day, seasons and a variety of lighting effects\n    Realistic air traffic control\n    Expandable library of vehicle models\n\nGo to the Experience page to see videos and screenshots of Prepar3DÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® in action!\n\n\nWhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s New in Prepar3D\n\nLockheed Martin continuously evolves Prepar3D to maintain its place as a front runner in the modeling and simulation marketplace. The latest features and functions available in Prepar3D include:\n\n    New user interface ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Users now have a Windows 7 compatible drag nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ drop interface with customizable settings. Quickly create and save your favorite missions.\n    Multiple monitor settings saved ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Users can quickly save panel and scenery window locations across multiple monitors with flight files. Prepar3D remembers the settings upon restarting a flight and restarting Prepar3D.\n    Internet multi-player capability ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Users across the globe can collaborate with others within the Prepar3D environment to train for their missions or tasks.\n    Multi-channel capability ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Users can harness the power of this new feature to operate Prepar3D with multiple computers creating a more expansive viewing capability all the way up to 360 degrees field of view.\n    Sensor camera options ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Users can experience night vision and infrared sensor camera options to enhance military mission or night flying training.\n    Realistic scenery ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Millions of square kilometers of the earth have been checked and upgraded to accurately represent the urban environment. High Resolution 12 cm content added for specific locations.\n    Higher quality graphics ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Users will experience higher quality graphics such as more realistic rainy or snowy weather with the modernized shader model 3.0. Also offered for higher quality graphics are increased texture limits which can be set as high as 4096 x 4096.\n    Underwater environments ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Users can take their simulation experience under water with submarines and the U.S. Geological SurveyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s coastal bathymetry.\n    Enhanced developer toolset ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Developers can use the Prepar3D environment to create new training solutions for the most modern platforms. To aid in rapid development, Prepar3D is now compatible with Windows 7 and Visual Studio 2010; it offers a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) user interface, an external simulator capability that provides enhanced control of the simulation code, new code samples updated in the Software Development Kit (SDK) documentation and support for the latest 3DStudio Max tools. Developers can also create a richer user experience with higher resolution terrain by taking advantage of the increased texture limits.\n    Expanded Hardware Controls ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Users, especially fighter pilots, can now train with realistic Hands On Throttle and Stick (HOTAS).\n\n\n\n\nNOT CRACKED !             $$$ Seed my internet Conection Is SLOW $$$\n\n****************************** ALEF1995 ******************************************\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6adcfe09f75007a6e107dbc516462b7377f4b02","amp;dn":"PREPAR3D+By+Lockheed+Martin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6adcfe09f75007a6e107dbc516462b7377f4b02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,173,207,224,159,117,0,122,110,16,125,188,81,100,98,183,55,127,75,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
