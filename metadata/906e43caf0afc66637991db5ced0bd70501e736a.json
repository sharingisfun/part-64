To that end, the book examines the sources of IslamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the Qur'an, the main religious text of Islam, and the Hadith, the deeds and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad. It contests the prevalent notion that Islam is built on violence in part by illuminating the role of the tolerant, mystical tradition of Sufism in Islam, while at the same time examining the misunderstood place of jihad in the religion. The book is not, however, a historical or theological treatise. Rather, it focuses on the tradition of nonviolence in modern Muslim societies. By spotlighting recent peaceful protest movements in Muslim communities, the book underscores the truly global and multicultural nature of the Islamic tradition of nonviolence. The findings here will be invaluable for Muslims and non-Muslims alike, revealing an alternative tradition both can embrace.\n\nPraeger 2011\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:906e43caf0afc66637991db5ced0bd70501e736a","amp;dn":"Islam+Means+Peace%3A+Understanding+the+Muslim+Principle+of+Nonviol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"906e43caf0afc66637991db5ced0bd70501e736a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,110,67,202,240,175,198,102,55,153,29,181,206,208,189,112,80,30,115,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
