It is not easy for Achim to get used to an adolescent around the house, especially since Sven hardly speaks to him. But Sven does well in school, and Achim hopes that time will bring them closer together. It is Achim's girlfriend Julia who first senses that something is wrong with Sven. Why, she wonders, does he always hang around with young boys?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73ddbca58ebbd1eacce0fcc4039b04fbc789c9e1","amp;dn":"Guter+Junge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73ddbca58ebbd1eacce0fcc4039b04fbc789c9e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,221,188,165,142,187,209,234,204,224,252,196,3,155,4,251,199,137,201,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
