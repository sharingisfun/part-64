Discovery&quot; on Chicken Fat, his debut for the label, and this album does feature a fantastic unique sound. Brown played in the bands of T-Bone Walker and John Lee Hooker, and has an aggressive (though not harsh) single-string picking style. For this date he is paired with either Herb Ellis or Arthur Wright on guitar, Gerald Wiggins on organ, and Brown's regular rhythm section of Paul Humphrey on drums and Ronald Brown on electric bass. There are a couple tracks that are played as pretty straight blues, but this is a hoppin' soul-jazz date. The tunes are bouncy and funky, and Brown's playing is a real treat. His bluesy, almost reckless soloing gives a vastly different flavor that the playing of guys like Grant Green or Melvin Sparks. Gerald Wiggins' organ playing is cool and swinging, and the electric bass of Ronald Brown makes this album about as funky as Impulse ever got. Both Herb Ellis and Arthur Wright get some solo space as well, with Ellis sounding quite interesting playing an unamplified 12-string on a couple cuts. Brown gets some nice tones as well, and on &quot;Hobo Flats&quot; plays &quot;an electronic guitar with Wah-Wah distortion&quot; (remember, this is 1967 jazz) &quot;that gives a weird shimmering sound,&quot; according to the liner notes. Leave it to Impulse! to put a new spin on the guitar/organ sound. This is hot stuff. ~ Sean Westergaard\n\nTracklist:\n01 Chicken Fat 04:16\n02 Greasy Spoon 05:53\n03 Home James 06:34\n04 Slalom 02:31\n05 Hobo Flats 02:18\n06 Shanty 04:40\n07 Sad But True 05:01\n08 I'm Goin' to Jackson 04:24\n09 Blues for Big Bob 04:25\n\nRecorded in Hollywood, California in May-June 1967.\n\nOriginally released on Impulse Records (9152).\n\nPersonnel:\nMel Brown (guitar); Oliver Nelson (arranger); Herb Ellis, Arthur Wright (guitar); Gerald Wiggins (organ); Ronald Brown (bass); Paul Humphrey (drums).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5cc08fcc935c5dece65b0b29a3ca2c5aa0cfec7","amp;dn":"Mel+Brown+Chiken+Fat%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5cc08fcc935c5dece65b0b29a3ca2c5aa0cfec7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,204,8,252,201,53,197,222,206,101,176,178,154,60,162,197,170,12,254,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
