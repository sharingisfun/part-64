The right source of funding should be a public pool - mainly taxes and expropriation of excess profits from the Bill gates genre if you get my drift.\n\nThe artists will make as much this way and everyone will have the music -\nsomething the artists should NOT begrudge or the music would be worthless\nanyways perhaps! (Not real Irish in that case eh)\n\ncheers! see you at the pub and ill sing you down if challenged to show\nin strength of Spirit!\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmusicfromrizzo\n\n\nOriginal irish Tenors 2006 CD (musicfromrizzo)\nChristopher Lynch - A Ballynure Ballad\nChristopher Lynch - I met her in the garden there the praties grow\nChristopher Lynch - Just a little bit of heaven\nChristopher Lynch - The Minstrel Boy\nChristopher Lynch - The Rose of Tralee\nDennis Day - Clancy lowered the boom\nDennis day - Galway Bay\nDennis Day - How can you buy Killarny\nDennis Day - St. Patrick's Parade\nFrank Parker - Danny Boy\nJohn McCormack - Kathleen Mavourneen\nJohn McCormack - Mother Machree\nJohn McCormack - The Wearing of the green\nMoron Downey - My wild Irish Rose\nMorotn Downey - The same old Shillelegh\nMorton Downey - Molly Brannigan\nMorton Downey - That's how you spell Ireland\nMorton Downey - Where the river shannon flows\nPhil Regan - A Sweet Irish Sweetheart of mein\nPhil Regan - Come back to Erin\nPhil Regan - When Irish eyes are smiling","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f77f9f82d458e22de7cf8dc76dda5fb8c824f472","amp;dn":"Original+Irish+Tenors+-+The+CD+%282006%29+320k+%28musicfromrizzo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f77f9f82d458e22de7cf8dc76dda5fb8c824f472","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,127,159,130,212,88,226,45,231,207,141,199,109,218,95,184,200,36,244,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
