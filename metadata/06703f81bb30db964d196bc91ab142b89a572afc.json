In these laboratories, students are put into a virtual environment where they are free to make the choices and decisions that they would confront in an actual laboratory and experience the resulting consequences. These products were created at Brigham Young University and include the individual products Virtual ChemLab, Virtual Physical Science, Virtual Physics, and Virtual Earth Science. All of these products are sold through Pearson Education at the middle school, high school, and higher education level. This web page provides tours of the different products, purchasing information, additional worksheet downloads, a discussion forum, FAQ, plus many other features. \n\nPlease contact us if you run into any problems with our new web site or especially if you would like to share your experiences using the virtual laboratories. Do you have a favorite worksheet? We would love to post it on the web site. Do you know of a teacher who should be featured? Please let us know.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://chemlab.byu.edu/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://chemlab.byu.edu/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06703f81bb30db964d196bc91ab142b89a572afc","amp;dn":"Virtual+ChemLab+2.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06703f81bb30db964d196bc91ab142b89a572afc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,112,63,129,187,48,219,150,77,25,107,201,26,177,66,184,154,87,42,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
