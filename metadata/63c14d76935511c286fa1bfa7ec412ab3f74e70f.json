He was primarily influenced by his teacher Elwood Buchanan and tonal masters such as Bobby Hackett, Harold &quot;Shorty&quot; Baker, Clark Terry and Freddie Webster. But it was the opportunity to play alongside Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie when Billy Eckstine's big band passed through St. Louis that inspired Miles to come to New York and attend Julliard in 1944.\n\nThe August 14, 1947 session was Miles' first as a leader and he already exhibits rudiments of timbre and phrasing that would distinguish his mature work. The presence of pianist John Lewis, Charlie Parker's use of tenor saxophone, and a more relaxed set of tempos distinguish this from his mentor's Savoy sesions. Lewis' &quot;Milestones&quot; (not to be confused with Miles' Columbia recording) is a relaxed, appealing line: Miles' muted horn and Bird's tenor blend for a burnished, mellow attack, and Miles employs both a more relaxed style of phrasing and a lighter attack than was popular among boppers. &quot;Little Willie Leaps&quot; (based on &quot;All God's Children Got Rhythm&quot;) is a brisker bop vehicle, and Bird dances lightly while Miles demonstrates plenty of rhythmic verve. &quot;Half Nelson&quot; and &quot;Sippin' At Bells&quot; offer more syncopated melodies, inspiring Bird to transcend the weightier aspects of his tenor, while Miles finds space for more nuanced details amidst the Dizzying harmonies.&quot;\n\nPersonnel:\nMiles Dewey Davis III - Trumpet\nRubberlegs Williams - Vocals\nHerbie Fields - Tenor Saxophone,Clarinet\nTeddy Brannon - Piano\nLeonard Gaskin - Bass\nEd Nicholson - Drums\nCharlie Parker - Tenor Saxophone\nJohn Lewis - Piano\nNelson Boyd - Bass\nMax Roach - Drums\n\nMiles Davis - First Miles Tracks\n01.
