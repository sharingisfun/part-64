Last they were saved as Quality 10 JPGs and lossless rotated to vertical where needed.\n\nThey are 2175 px on the short side, 3400 long side for 2 page and 4548 for 3 page gatefolds.  Since they are from the C2C drive, they have NOT been butchered by some hamfisted correction or &quot;restoration&quot; algorithm (as is the case with most of the CyberClub images), and they still have the original &quot;Playmate Of The Month&quot; text as first printed.  I'm fairly certain that the folks that made the C2C drive used the centerfold masters from the bound The Complete Centerfolds coffee table book for scanning - you know, the big one that came in an attache case.\n\nNOTE: April 1955 CF of Marilyn Waltz is a truly horrible gatefold as to color - I did my best, but I'm not at all happy with it.\n\n1960s is being worked on as should upload around the 1st of Sept.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce07149c9f1a64ac673468a7b9b7cea6596afc5d","amp;dn":"Playboy+Centerfolds+1950s+-+Large+size","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce07149c9f1a64ac673468a7b9b7cea6596afc5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,7,20,156,159,26,100,172,103,52,104,167,185,183,206,166,89,106,252,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
