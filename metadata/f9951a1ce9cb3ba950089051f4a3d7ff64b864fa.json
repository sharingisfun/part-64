Rex on the Electric Warrior LP\n   The big ones on here were \\&quot;Numbers With Wings\\&quot;\nand \\&quot;Barbarella\\&quot; but \\&quot;Sweet Blue Cage\\&quot; is classic\nBongos and very nice. Oh both of my Bongos Torrents\nare Flac, and have \\&quot;Replay Gain\\&quot; which actually lowers\nthe volume, sort of a \\&quot;Normalizing\\&quot; thing. It can be\nremoved though, since it\\'s just a command to the player\nit doesn\\'t actually change the file, but on playback\nit does make the player volume lower.  So if you remove\nthe Replay Gain from the files, you will have louder \nflac files.  Oh well have fun playing with that if\nyou like, but here it is, Numbers With Wings \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9951a1ce9cb3ba950089051f4a3d7ff64b864fa","amp;dn":"Bongos_NWW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9951a1ce9cb3ba950089051f4a3d7ff64b864fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,149,26,28,233,203,59,169,80,8,144,81,244,163,215,255,100,184,100,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
