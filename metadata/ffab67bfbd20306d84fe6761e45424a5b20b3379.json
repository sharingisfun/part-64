After his departure for France in the 1980s, where he performed in jazz clubs, Seydina Insa Wade was somewhat forgotten by his countrymen and women. Observing that the new generation in Senegal was unfamiliar with his music, he decided to regain contact with his country and returned to Dakar to record his latest numbers. Ousmane William Mbaye followed this return to the home country for two years, and the friendship which grew up between the two men provides us with a sensitive and highly personal portrait of the musician: through his personal statements and songs, we discover a constantly moving, multifaceted personality.\n\nRÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©alisation-Directed by : Ousmane William Mbaye\nScÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nario-Screenplay : Ousmane William Mbaye\nImage-Cinematography : Ousmane William Mbaye\nSon-Sound : Ousmane William Mbaye, Myriam RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©\nMontage-Editor : Laurence Attali\nMusique-Music : Seydina Insa Wade\nProduction : Les Films Mame Yande (Dakar), Autoproduction\n\nFile Name .........................................: Xalima la plume.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 765,218,816 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 51:02.760\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 704x512 (AR: 1.375)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1733 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.192 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 256 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\nNo IMDB entry for the film.\n\nFor information, refer to http://www.africultures.com/php/index.php?nav=film&amp;no=619\n\nSenegalese and french audio; French, English, Spanish and Portuguese subpack\n\nMy rip\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffab67bfbd20306d84fe6761e45424a5b20b3379","amp;dn":"Xalima+la+plume+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffab67bfbd20306d84fe6761e45424a5b20b3379","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,171,103,191,189,32,48,109,132,254,103,97,228,84,36,165,178,11,51,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
