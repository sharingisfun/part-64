I have edited out the  \nmusic played during the commercial breaks.\n\nNotes: So, I may have a different perspective on this since I'm editing these streams every day for the past 8 months... but is Glenn Beck getting lazy as far as Radio rules go?  In the past couple of months he has gotten a little lazy or loose in throwing to commercial breaks (live or not), and he talks very deep into the outro music that hands off to local radio affiliates... today I have two distinct examples.  \n\nIn Hour 2, he talks us out to nothing, where he should be doing a live commercial and dead air is there until he suddenly jumps into the live commercial he should have been doing.  I left this in and faced out during the commercial as it was standard.  \n\nHour 3 they all 3 (Glenn/Pat/Stu) all talk well over the end of the show (where normally you'd hear &quot;Mercury&quot; that I always use to fade out of Hr3) and well into the music where again the Radio affiliates should be taking over.\n\nAnyways, sorry for rambling, just wondering if anybody else notices... :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d8f3da2e52efb4bfa5d424c93915602dec13ead","amp;dn":"Glenn+Beck+2011-08-30+%28Radio+Web+Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d8f3da2e52efb4bfa5d424c93915602dec13ead","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,143,61,162,229,46,251,75,250,93,66,76,147,145,86,2,222,193,62,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
