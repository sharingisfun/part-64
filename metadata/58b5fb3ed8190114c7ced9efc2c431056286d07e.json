The film then focuses on Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin), a teenager who discovers he has a new neighbor moving in next door to him. Upon arriving at school Charley\\'s ex-friend, \\&quot;Evil\\&quot; Ed Lee (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), informs him that many fellow students have gone missing. Charley disregards this, but Ed blackmails him into coming to an old friend\\'s house to check if he is alright.\n \nWhen Charley goes home after school, his mother (Toni Collette) introduces him to Jerry, who is the new neighbor. Charley eventually remembers to meet up with Ed who informs him that his new neighbor is a vampire. Charley gets fed up with Ed and leaves. On his way home Ed is harassed by a bully (Dave Franco). He manages to escape but is confronted by Jerry who convinces him to become a vampire and bites him. The next day Charley realizes that Ed is missing and decides to go to his house to investigate.\n \nAs Jerry begins to attack more people throughout the neighborhood, Charley goes into Jerry\\'s house and finds out that he is keeping all of his victims in secret rooms. Charley manages to save one of his victims but she burns in the sunlight during their escape, as she has been bitten.\n \nCharley decides to go to Las Vegas magician Peter Vincent (David Tennant), a supposed expert on vampires. Unfortunately, Vincent does not take him seriously, and kicks him out.\n \nJerry comes to Charley\\'s house the next day and complains to his mother, but Charley convinces her not to let him in. Reasoning that if there\\'s no house, he needs no invitation to enter in order to claim his victims, Jerry ignites the natural gas in the house and blows it up. Charley, his mother, and his girlfriend, Amy Peterson (Imogen Poots), barely escape with their lives. Jerry chases them with his car until being staked by Charley\\'s mother, who faints afterwards.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE FILES 2011\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58b5fb3ed8190114c7ced9efc2c431056286d07e","amp;dn":"Fright+Night+2011+RMVB+GLOBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58b5fb3ed8190114c7ced9efc2c431056286d07e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,181,251,62,216,25,1,20,199,206,217,239,194,196,49,5,98,134,208,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
