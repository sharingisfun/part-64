Acclaimed historian G. J. Meyer reveals \nthe flesh-and-bone reality in all its wild excess.\n\nIn 1485, young Henry Tudor, whose claim to the throne was so weak as \nto be almost laughable, crossed the English Channel from France at the \nhead of a ragtag little army and took the crown from the family that \nhad ruled England for almost four hundred years. Half a century later \nhis son, Henry VIII, desperate to rid himself of his first wife in order \nto marry a second, launched a reign of terror aimed at taking powers \nno previous monarch had even dreamed of possessing. In the process he \nplunged his kingdom into generations of division and disorder, creating \na legacy of blood and betrayal that would blight the lives of his children \nand the destiny of his country.\n\nThe boy king Edward VI, a fervent believer in reforming the English \nchurch, died before bringing to fruition his dream of a second English \nReformation. Mary I, the disgraced daughter of Catherine of Aragon, \ntried and failed to reestablish the Catholic Church and produce an heir. \nAnd finally came Elizabeth I, who devoted her life to creating an image \nof herself as Gloriana the Virgin Queen but, behind that mask, sacrificed \nall chance of personal happiness in order to survive.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9cfcf8d4126bfc01e40a84852d96409c30cd4ea","amp;dn":"The+Tudors+-+G+J+Meyer++%282010+-+Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9cfcf8d4126bfc01e40a84852d96409c30cd4ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,207,207,141,65,38,191,192,30,64,168,72,82,217,100,9,195,12,212,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
