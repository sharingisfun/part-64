This book is a part of a four volume collection (covering material aspects, physical effects, characterization and modeling, and applications) and focuses on the application of ferroelectric devices to innovative systems. In particular, the use of these materials as varying capacitors, gyroscope, acoustics sensors and actuators, microgenerators and memory devices will be exposed, providing an up-to-date review of recent scientific findings and recent advances in the field of ferroelectric devices.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c911277133ac19b64ee2f0f963a91609e2da2195","amp;dn":"Ferroelectrics+-+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c911277133ac19b64ee2f0f963a91609e2da2195","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,17,39,113,51,172,25,182,78,226,240,249,99,169,22,9,226,218,33,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
