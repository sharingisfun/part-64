As you begin to explore the planet, you unearth a cache of treasures from the masters of Science Fiction... Leonard Nimoy is your host in this fully interactive archive of science fiction masterpieces. There's one full hour of video clips of featured scholars, artists, authors, and more! You'll also get a complete unedited collection of HARD TO FIND NOVELS, browse a virtual museum of sci-fi art, and truly too much to even list! Oh - but I just can't stop telling you about this title! Do you love Jules Verne? Then you will be utterly thrilled that this CD-ROM contains 4 of his very best works! There's also H.G. Wells, Mary Shelley, Bram Stoker, Robert Lewis Stevenson, and even Edgar Allan Poe! If you or a loved one you know is a fan of great Science Fiction you *MUST* have this title in your collection!&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Leonard-Nimoy-Science-Fiction-Vol-1/dp/B000BFV97C&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Leonard-Nimoy-Science-Fiction-Vol-1/dp/B000BFV97C&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis is ONLY Volume 1! I don't have the other volume (I wish I did...)\n\nIt was designed for old Windows, but it actually kind of works in Windows 7 if you install the included old Quicktime. Really, the only things worth looking at are the videos and the text. I've dumped and converted the videos, but I can't do that for the text as it's a Shockwave Director file (I believe) and I don't have that program right now. I believe it's BOOK1.DIR or a similarly named file.\n\nNote that the whole ISO (software and all) *is* included. You need 7zip to open the archive.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa990a5ea4efaec3e9c38d8fd58088d01b7e0ae9","amp;dn":"Leonard+Nimoy+Science+Fiction+Volume+1+-+The+Gold+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa990a5ea4efaec3e9c38d8fd58088d01b7e0ae9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,153,10,94,164,239,174,195,233,195,141,143,213,128,136,208,27,126,10,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
