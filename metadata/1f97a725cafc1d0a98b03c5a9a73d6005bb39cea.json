Jennet Device, a \nbeggar-girl from Pendle in Lancashire, was the star \nwitness in the trial in 1612 of her own mother, her brother, \nher sister and many of her neighbours and, thanks to her \nchilling testimony, they were all hanged.Armitage explores \nthe lethal power and influence of one child's words - a \nstory of fear, magic and demonic pacts retold partly with \nvivid and innovative hand-drawn animation. He discovers \nhow Jennet's appearance in the witness box cast its shadow way beyond Lancashire, impressing lawyers, politicians, clerics and even King James I himself, and setting a dark precedent for child testimony in witch trials as far away as America. Finally, in a dramatic twist to the tale, he reveals how, twenty two years after the original trial, Jennet's own words were very nearly the death of her - when she herself was put on trial, accused of being a witch by a 10-year-old boy.\nWith the help of historians Malcolm Gaskill, Diane Purkiss \nand Ronald Hutton, Armitage attempts to get inside Jennet's \nhead and understand how the illegitimate and illiterate \nyoungest child of a family of beggars could become both \npawn and player in a much bigger story of 17th century \nreligion, power, law, science and the monarchy.\nWhat made Jennet speak out so everyone she knew \nwould die? And how did the courts decide to admit her \nevidence and allow her example to create a precedent \nfor accepting the testimony of other child witnesses who \nwanted to send their neighbours to the gallows?\nAlthough the events in this film may date back four \nhundred years, its issues resonate today as much as \never - when to believe our children, how the police and \nthe court system should handle child witnesses and \nabove all how, in times of crisis, fear of evil can easily \nlead us to behave in ways which may corrode the very \nvalues that we most wish to protect.\n\nURL Link : \n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n:::                             Other Notes                             :::\n:::                             -----------                             :::\n:::                                                                     :::\n:::                                                                     :::\n:::                                                                     :::\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n:::                             Group Notes                             :::\n:::                             -----------                             :::\n:::                                                                     :::\n:::             We are not currently looking for any new sites          :::\n:::                                                                     :::\n:::                                                                     :::\n:::                               Greets                                :::\n:::                               ------                                :::\n:::                                                                     :::\n:::                                                                     :::\n:::               (All The Uk Groups That Do There Share)               :::\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nNFO Creator v.1 Coded by Us","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f97a725cafc1d0a98b03c5a9a73d6005bb39cea","amp;dn":"The.Pendle.Witch.Child.HDTV.XviD-FTP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f97a725cafc1d0a98b03c5a9a73d6005bb39cea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,151,167,37,202,252,29,10,152,176,60,90,154,115,214,0,91,179,156,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
