It took me a while to find this since every torrent on the net seemed to be dead and the Shamen discography's don't include it but I found a copy regardless. I haven't had the chance to check out the quality although the place I got it from claimed it to be 320kbps.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n   1.  &quot;Mercury&quot;\n   2.  &quot;Universal - 187 B.P. Metamix (Minor)&quot;\n   3.  &quot;Palen - K&quot;\n   4.  &quot;Beamship Captain is Insane-Crazy Mr Anderson Remix&quot;\n   5.  &quot;I Do&quot;\n   6.  &quot;Pop&quot;\n   7.  &quot;Universal - 1999 Dance Vocal&quot;\n   8.  &quot;Sativa '98&quot;\n   9.  &quot;Serpent&quot;\n   10. &quot;U Nations - Mr C Club Mix&quot;\n   11. &quot;Marca Huasi&quot;\n   12. &quot;Sfynx - Technical Itch Mix&quot;\n   13. &quot;Metatron&quot;\n\nPlease seed for others if it's all good.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f1c99afdabcf077dfde03bf5fd2e21499891d6a","amp;dn":"Shamen+-+UV+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f1c99afdabcf077dfde03bf5fd2e21499891d6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,28,153,175,218,188,240,119,223,222,3,191,95,210,226,20,153,137,29,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
