Traditionally addiction was seen as, at least in the initiation of the addiction, moral failingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦a weakness of mind. Modern research has brought such ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“common senseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ into doubt. The ASAM statement holds that an addition is really a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbio-psycho-socio-spiritualÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ illness.\nThough addicts canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t choose not to be addicts, they can choose to get treatment. Recovery, ASAM says, is best realized not just by self-management and mutual support groups such as 12-step fellowships, but also with trained professional help. The ASAMÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s timing corresponds with the current revamping of American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental DisordersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the bible of the mental health profession.\nWhy is it a highlight? I would like our listeners to check out the links on the show notes and let us know if you agree with addiction as a disease, the use of the spirituality in treating addiction, 12-step programsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦this will likely be a future segment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cac1cac0234a162e7719feb10425400775cf082","amp;dn":"Radio+FreeThinker+-+Tyson+Talks+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cac1cac0234a162e7719feb10425400775cf082","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,172,28,172,2,52,161,98,231,113,159,235,16,66,84,0,119,92,240,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
