There should be a torrent in here for everything that has been officially released and a few things that haven't (like torrents for all the soundboard concert recordings that can be found here on TPB). Most everything is at least 320kbps and some are FLAC. A few notes:\n\n-There are multiple versions of some items. You don't need both. Just pick the bitrate you want and download that.\n\n-Some torrents have multiple releases in the torrent. I've listed the ones that will complete in the name of the file. Use a client that allows you to select which files to skip and which to get.\n\n-Very few of the video torrents have seeds. This part is going to be trial and error sorry.\n\n-I may update this in the future. I took the time to figure out the bit rates of everything so if you have a suggestion I just ask that you do the same. Just leave a link, the bit rate and whether or not the torrent has seeds.\n\nGrateful Dead - Albums - Beyond Description (1973-1989 Albums Remastered + Bonus) - FLAC.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Albums - Golden Road and Beyond Description (Remastered + Bonus) - MP3 320 kbps.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Albums - The Golden Road (1965-1973 Albums Remastered + Bonus) - FLAC.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Dick's Picks 1-10 - Various Bitrates - Mostly 128 and 192.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Dick's Picks 11-22 - Various Bitrates - Mostly 128 and 192.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Dick's Picks 1-36 - FLAC.torrent         \nGrateful Dead - Dick's Picks 1-36 - MP3 320kbps.torrent  \nGrateful Dead - Dick's Picks 23-29 - Various Bitrates - Mostly 128 and 192.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Dick's Picks 30-36 - Various Bitrates - Mostly 128 and 192.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Download Series 1-12 - Complete - FLAC.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Download Series 1-12 - Some Songs Missing - MP3 VBR ~192kbps.torrent\nGrateful Dead - From The Vault 1-3 - Box Set - FLAC.torrent\nGrateful Dead - From The Vault 1-3 - MP3 VBR ~192kbps.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Live CDs - Fillmore West 1969 The Complete Recordings - FLAC.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Live CDs - Go to Nassau - MP3 320 - ed2k link inside.txt\nGrateful Dead - Live CDs - Go To Nassau (5-15 &amp; 5-16 1980) - MP3 320kbps.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Live CDs - Hundred Year Hall - FLAC.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Live CDs - Live at the Cow Palace New Year's Eve 1976 - FLAC.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Live CDs - Postcards of the Hanging - FLAC.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Live CDs - Rockin the Rhein - FLAC.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Live CDs - Rocking the Cradle - FLAC (has DVD ISO also).torrent\nGrateful Dead - Live CDs - To Terrapin (Hartford '77) - FLAC.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Live CDs - Truckin' Up To Buffalo - MP3 320.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Live CDs - Without A Net - FLAC.torrent    \nGrateful Dead - Live CDs (Knick, Phil Zone, View Vaults Sndtracks, Fillmore E, Diamonds, Postcards, Winterland) - MP3 320.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Live CDs (Ladies and Gentlemen, Closing of Winterland) - FLAC.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Pre-Dead - Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions - FLAC.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Rare Cuts and Oddities - FLAC.torrent      \nGrateful Dead - Road Trips - Through Vol 4 No 2 (March 2011) - FLAC.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Road Trips - Vol 4 No  3 - FLAC.torrent    \nGrateful Dead - Road Trips Full Shows - 11-05 &amp; 06-79 (pitch - speed corrected) - FLAC.torrent\nGrateful Dead - Show (Red Rocks) - MP3 192.torrent        \nGrateful Dead - So Many Roads - M4A ALAC Apple Lossless.torrent\nGrateful Dead Shows Soundboard - How-to trick to download sbd directly from archive.org.txt\nGrateful Dead Shows Soundboard Torrents - 1965-95 - 41 torrents - MP3 VBR ~192kbps.zip\nGrateful Dead Torrents - All Video - DVD and AVI.zip    \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4afc0ad8eae453d537bb58e0bf05416f56d9d985","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+All+Torrents+Version+1+%28Aug+2011%29+-+Video+and+Au","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4afc0ad8eae453d537bb58e0bf05416f56d9d985","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,252,10,216,234,228,83,213,55,187,88,224,191,5,65,111,86,217,217,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
