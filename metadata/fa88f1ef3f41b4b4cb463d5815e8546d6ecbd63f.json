The EP starts out with the title track &quot;Best I Never Had&quot;. The verses feature Leahy's smooth effortless vocals over a tight-knit unit of instruments, breaking into a bittersweet chorus about regret. As the EP pushes on, the next song is &quot;Oceans Between Us&quot;, and this is where the EP really starts to get going. The Best I Never Had EP is a striking major-label debut. The Downtown Fiction prove themselves worthy of the praise they have received and definitely know how to put out a damn good record. Every song on the album comes straight from the heart. The Downtown Fiction has established itself as serious competition for others in the scene-and they're definitely a band to watch out for.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa88f1ef3f41b4b4cb463d5815e8546d6ecbd63f","amp;dn":"The+Downtown+Fiction+-+Best+I+Never+Had","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa88f1ef3f41b4b4cb463d5815e8546d6ecbd63f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,136,241,239,63,65,180,180,203,70,61,88,21,232,84,109,110,203,214,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
