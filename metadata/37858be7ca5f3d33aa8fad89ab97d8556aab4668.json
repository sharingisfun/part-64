Here is a tool that enhances the right-click menu of title bars and taskbar icons.\n\nPowerMenu has been around for over a decade. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a very simple, yet incredibly useful tool that is compatible up to Windows Vista. PowerMenu adds extra menu options to all top level system menus, while the standard options remain intact. Some of the features include: minimize to tray, keep windows on top, make windows transparent, and more.\n\nKeep Windows Always on Top\n\nThis option is very useful when you want to keep a window on top, no matter what youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re doing on the side. If you multitask a lot, this one is a must.\nMake Windows Transparent\n\nMaking a window transparent obviously lets you see what sits below it. I can imagine this could be useful when youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re working with limited screen space and need to check for references below the window in which youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re typing. Personally, I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have a use for this feature.\n\nPriority\n\nThe higher the priority of a program, the more processing power it will receive. This one is useful when you have a lot of processes running in the background that are not urgent and you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to steal power from the applications you are currently using. You simply reduce the priority of the programs running in the background and increase the priority of the tools youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re actively using.\n\nMinimize to Tray\n\nThe taskbar provides only limited space and PowerMenu lets you minimize programs to the tray. I love this feature as it allows me to remove distracting clutter from the taskbar, for example programs quietly running in the background like Winamp or Napster.\nCommand Line Options\n\nWith the help of command line options PowerMenu can perform additional tasks, for example hide its system tray icon. Or it can run a specific option on all windows with a certain word in the title bar, for example make windows containing the word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMozillaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œalways on topÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. All options can be found within the help file of Power Menu which is accessible through the icon in the sytem tray.\n\n \n~ Seed 4 others,Others would seed 4 u ~\n         Be a Gentleman!!\n\n    ______            ______   _______    \n   (  __  \\ |\\     /|(  __  \\ (  ____ \\   \n   | (  \\  )| )   ( || (  \\  )| (    \\/   \n   | |   ) || |   | || |   ) || (__       \n   | |   | || |   | || |   | ||  __)      \n   | |   ) || |   | || |   ) || (         \n _ | (__/  )| (___) || (__/  )| (____/\\ _ \n(_)(______/ (_______)(______/ (_______/(_)\n\n\nA simple THANKS goes a long way... :-)\nAny comments would b appreciated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37858be7ca5f3d33aa8fad89ab97d8556aab4668","amp;dn":"PowerMenuSetup_1_5_1+%5B.Dude.%5D.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37858be7ca5f3d33aa8fad89ab97d8556aab4668","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,133,139,231,202,95,61,51,170,143,173,137,171,151,216,85,106,171,70,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
