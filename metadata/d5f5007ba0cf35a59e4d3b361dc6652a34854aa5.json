What compels people to respond to devastating, unpredictable eventsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½terrorist acts, wars, natural disasters, economic upheavalsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with the conviction that nothing is a coincidence, nothing is as it seems, and everything is connected?\n\nConspiracy Rising: Conspiracy Thinking and American Public Life argues that while outlandish paranoid theories themselves may seem nonsensical, the thread of conspiracy thinking throughout American history is a both a byproduct of our democratic form of government and a very real threat to it. From the Illuminati, the Knights Templar, and the Freemasons to the government hiding aliens and faking the moon landing; from the New World Order to the Obama &quot;Birthers,&quot; the book explores the enduring popularity of a number of American conspiracy theories, showing how the conspiracy hysteria that may provoke disdain and apathy in the general public, can become a source of dangerous extremism. \n\nJune 2011\nPublisher: ABC-CLIO, Incorporated\nFormat: Hardcover 168pp \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5f5007ba0cf35a59e4d3b361dc6652a34854aa5","amp;dn":"Conspiracy+Rising%3A+Conspiracy+Thinking+and+American+Public+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5f5007ba0cf35a59e4d3b361dc6652a34854aa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,245,0,123,160,207,53,165,158,77,59,54,29,198,101,42,52,133,74,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
