Haney \nNarrated by Robertson Dean\n\n\n\nDelta ForceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the US ArmyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most elite top-secret strike force. They dominate the modern battlefield, but you wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t hear about their heroics on CNN. No headlines can reveal their top-secret missions, and no book has ever taken readers insideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½until now. Here, a founding member of Delta Force takes us behind the veil of secrecy and into the action to reveal the never-before-told story of First Special Forces Operational Detachment-D (Delta Force). \n\n\nHe is a master of espionage, trained to take on hijackers, terrorists, and enemy armies. He can deploy by parachute or arrive by commercial aircraft, survive alone in hostile cities, speak foreign languages fluently, strike at enemy targets with stunning swiftness and extraordinary teamwork. He is the ultimate modern warrior: the Delta Force operator. \n\nIn this dramatic chronicle, Eric Haney, one of the founding members of Delta Force, takes us inside this legendary counterterrorist unit. Here, for the first time, are details of the grueling selection processÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½designed to break the strongest of menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that singles out the best of the best. \n\nWith heart-stopping immediacy, Haney tells what itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s really like to enter a hostage-held airplane. From his days in Beirut, he tells a remarkable tale of bodyguards and bombs, of a day-to-day life of madness and beauty, and of how he and a teammate are called on to kill two gunmen targeting US Marines at an airport. As part of the team sent to rescue American hostages in Tehran, Haney offers a first-person description of that failed mission that is a chilling, compelling account of a bold maneuver undone by chanceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and a few fatal mistakes. \n\nFrom fighting guerrilla warfare in Honduras to rescuing missionaries in Sudan and leading the way onto the island of Grenada, Haney captures the daring and discipline that distinguish the men of Delta Force. Inside Delta Force brings honor to these singular men while it puts us in the middle of around-the-world action that is sudden, frightening, and nonstop.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79dc90dba8cec1aec6d7cd4dc3bd668f2870ecfc","amp;dn":"Inside+Delta+Force+-+Eric+L.+Haney++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79dc90dba8cec1aec6d7cd4dc3bd668f2870ecfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,220,144,219,168,206,193,174,198,215,205,77,195,189,102,143,40,112,236,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
