After a lifetime journey of pursuing that question, my research revealed that a small group of financial elite have gained control over key areas of our lives ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ energy, food, health care, education and more ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and are the single greatest threat to humanityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ability to thrive.\n\nAs I researched the problems in each Sector of human activity, I came to the shocking realization that virtually every problem we face is human-caused. But then I realized what good news this actually is. If there were a comet plummeting toward Earth or the planet was careening out of orbit we would be at a loss as to what to do. If, on the other hand, people caused it, we have a better chance of being able to fix it as we wake up, expose corruption and align with natural principles.\n\nIt is not that humans are incapable of thriving. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s that weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been duped into a system that is designed to consolidate wealth and power, rather than provide a real opportunity for people to thrive. By exposing this agenda, strategically challenging deceptive systems such as central banks and fiat money, and coming up with new ways to organize and cooperate, we can obsolete this destructive agenda and liberate our planet and our true human potential.\n\nAt first, an agenda to control others was hard for me to consider. But as I spent many years getting myself educated about it, many things that hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t made sense began to fall into place. A different story began to emerge which, horrible as it was to consider, actually explained more than ever before and provided a feeling achieving some traction in what I could do about our predicament. I came to realize the desperate drive to dominate others is based in a worldview of scarcity and fear. The controlling elite seem to believe the only options are to control, or be controlled, and realizing that gave me a better understanding of why they have chosen their current route. Now it is up to the rest of us to transcend this destructive belief system and show that we are capable of governing ourselvesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ that we actually can thrive.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac4c425cbef215dcde7cb7fea75c6ebfdc942472","amp;dn":"Thrive+-+The+Documentary++HD++MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac4c425cbef215dcde7cb7fea75c6ebfdc942472","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,76,66,92,190,242,21,220,222,124,183,254,167,92,110,191,220,148,36,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
