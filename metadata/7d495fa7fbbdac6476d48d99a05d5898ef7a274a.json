The project is \nthe follow-up to the band's Grammy Award-winning, multi-platinum album, \n'Need You Now.'\n\n&quot;We're definitely more in tune with each other musically and personally than \never,&quot; says band member Dave Haywood. &quot;It's an exciting place to be. This \nalbum was created from the ground up -- we are writing these songs, playing \nthese instruments and creating these arrangements. With 'Own The Night,' \nmore than ever before, we share a real feeling of accomplishment both as a \nband and as friends.&quot;\n\nThe talented trio return with producer credits on the new project, once again \ncollaborating with veteran producer Paul Worley. Band members Charles \nKelley, Dave Haywood and Hillary Scott wrote or co-wrote 10 of the album's \n12 tracks.\n\n&quot;Our only hope and expectation for this record is that it will build on the first \ntwo,&quot; Charles admits. &quot;At the end of the day, we just want our fans to be \nable to say that we continue to give them solid albums with solid songs they \ncan enjoy from start to finish.&quot;\n\nThe album's first single 'Just a Kiss' is the band's fast-rising single to date, \ncurrently sitting at No. 6 on Billboard's Country Songs chart.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor More Downloads Visit www.Mp3BoXx.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d495fa7fbbdac6476d48d99a05d5898ef7a274a","amp;dn":"Lady+Antebellum+-+Own+The+Night+%282011%29+-%3DMp3BoXx%3D-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d495fa7fbbdac6476d48d99a05d5898ef7a274a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,73,95,167,251,189,172,100,118,212,141,153,160,93,88,152,239,122,39,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
