I saw this movie when it came out and thought it was great, and it seemed to do very well in Southern CA, but it is largely forgotten.  Check it out.  IMDB rating aren't really favorable, but anymore I'm starting to think that that might be the sign of a decent movie.  This is a copy obtained from some independent movie channel, it is complete and unedited.  The picture is a little grainy, but very watchable.  Sound is perfect.  Thanks to the weird foreign blogspot for the upload, and to google translate.
