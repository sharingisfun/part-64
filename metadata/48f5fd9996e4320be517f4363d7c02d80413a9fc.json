Our goal is to provide a ready to use, easy to install, desktop and laptop optimized operating system based on Debian's testing branch and the latest stable release of GNOME desktop environment. Also it is possible to install extra software packages from Parsix APT repositories. Our annual release cycle consists of two major and four minor versions. We have our own software repositories and build servers to build and provide all the necessary updates and missing features in Debian testing branch. \n\nWhat's New in 3.7r0?\nParsix GNU/Linux 3.7 (code name Raul) release brings tons of updated packages, faster live boot and quality new features. This version has been synchronized with Debian testing repositories as of Feb 7, 2010 and brings lot of updated packages compared to Parsix 3.6 aka Vinnie. Parsix DVD images are compiled using SquashFS 4.0 with LZMA compression. Our brand new Linux 2.6.37.6 based kernel with improved configuration is patched using TuxOnIce 3.2 suspension/hibernation, Kon Kolivas's BFS and extra hardware support patches. For the first time we are including certain drivers from kernel's staging tree including the new experimental nouveau graphics diver for nVidia chips. Updated installer provides even simpler interface and enables installing Parsix on existing software RAID partitions. Some changes have been made to the default applications stack: Parsix is now being shipped with XBMC media center, Adidemux video editor, Remmina replaces Tsclient and Exile is no longer shipped with the ISOs. Parsix Raul has a brand new light and fast look and feel. Parsix 3.7 default features: NetworkManager 0.8.1 as default networking stack, GRUB 2 boot loader and ext4 file system, and X.Org 7.5. Highlights: GNOME 2.32.1, X.Org 7.5, GRUB 2, GNU Iceweasel 5.0, GParted 0.8.1, Empathy 2.30.3, OpenOffice.org 3.2.1, Compiz-Fusion 0.8.4 and, VirtualBox-OSE 4.0.4. Please note that Raul is also covered by security updates. \n...\nRelease Notes : http://www.parsix.org/wiki/ReleaseNotes37r0\nWeb site : http://www.parsix.org/wiki\nForum : http://forums.parsix.org/ (en, fa)\n\nmd5sum : b1cbd60edfd9e9581881a468c5bc0115  parsix_3.7r0-amd64.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48f5fd9996e4320be517f4363d7c02d80413a9fc","amp;dn":"parsix_3.7r0-amd64.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48f5fd9996e4320be517f4363d7c02d80413a9fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,245,253,153,150,228,50,11,229,23,244,54,61,124,2,216,4,19,169,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
