However..now it is out of print (and has been for some time)! A few selections are on the recording, &quot;Mosaic Select&quot;. \n\nI hope you will realize how great this musician is and support him. How? By buying his &quot;in print&quot; recordings!!!!\n\nThis is one guy that did not get the credit he deserved! Wonderful musician. Great voice on the trumpet! \n\n\nOn The Nile.flac 76.23 MB \nMother Wit.flac 47.83 MB \nPlight.flac 45.07 MB \nThe Ringer.flac 37.65 MB \nSpur.flac 30.22 MB \nC,T.
