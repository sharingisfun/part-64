Although you won't\nfind any new birds to shoot, each theme brings new obstacles\nand nicely designed landscapes through which to fling your\nfeathered fliers.\n\nInstallation Instructions\n\nInstall\nCopy cracked exe to install directory\nRegister with any key\nHave fun!\n\nIf you like this game, buy it! :)\n\nErES - Group Information\n\nHere at ErES we consider each member as more than just a collegue or a\nfriend, but as a family member. It's been just over two and a half\nyears since ErES was established and in that time in the scene we've\nproduced many quality releases because of our attitude not only as a\ngroup -- but as individuals; each member of the group has shown\nrespect and friendship and in return offers loyalty that could only be\nfound when part of a tight-knit family. We are not a release\nmachine and never intend to be. We have a relaxed, yet hard-working\nattitude towards producing releases and you can see this through all\nof our current (and future) releases.\n\nIf you feel ErES is a family that you want to be part of\nwe have listed below the currently open positions and things we\nrequire:\n\nExperienced reversers for all Operating Systems;\nSkilled coders;\nQuality suppliers;\nGood 100Mbit+ EU &amp; Asia Sites to affil with;\nAnything else you think we might like!\n\ne r e s g r p  a t  g m a i l . c o m\n\nascii/nfo:...........ph0!SiLK    updated:............16.04.2010","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33cda3b68e6d43a90cb9ce46b45a3d7b4ef90b41","amp;dn":"Angry.Birds.Seasons.v1.5.1.Cracked.GAME-ErES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33cda3b68e6d43a90cb9ce46b45a3d7b4ef90b41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,205,163,182,142,109,67,169,12,185,206,70,180,90,61,123,78,249,11,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
