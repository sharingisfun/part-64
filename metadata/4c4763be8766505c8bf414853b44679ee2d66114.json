Play as Kris Kringle in this heartwarming yuletide adventure based on the classic Christmas TV special. Carry out your mission of delivering toys to the kids in Sombertown, overcoming challenges in platform-based levels. While Christmas has 12 days, the game more than doubles that, giving you 25 levels of Christmas cheer to explore. You can share the adventure with a friend (playing as Topper the penguin) in two-player Story Mode. Surprises (more presents!) await throughout the game in stockings you can discover to unlock bonus content.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c4763be8766505c8bf414853b44679ee2d66114","amp;dn":"SX5E4Z.wbfs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c4763be8766505c8bf414853b44679ee2d66114","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,71,99,190,135,102,80,92,139,244,20,133,59,68,103,158,226,214,97,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
