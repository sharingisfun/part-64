It was considered a major return upon release for McCartney because he was embarking on his first world tour since the Wings Over the World jaunt back in 1975/1976. Flowers in the Dirt was also celebrated due to its musical quality, which earned McCartney his best reviews in years.\n\n\nAfter the meagre sales that greeted Press to Play, McCartney realized that he needed to work much harder on his follow-up. Thus, he not only teamed up with several different producers, but also spent the better part of eighteen months perfecting Flowers in the Dirt. A highlight of the sessions was McCartney's productive alliance with Elvis Costello, with whom he composed many new songs. McCartney greatly enjoyed the partnership, even finding that Costello mirrored John Lennon in certain aspects of his personality. Costello would also appear on the album, even co-singing &quot;You Want Her Too&quot; with Paul. Another celebrity guest included was friend David Gilmour from Pink Floyd, who plays guitar on &quot;We Got Married&quot;.\n\nKnowing full well he intended to launch the biggest tour of his career thus far, McCartney also put together a regular band to take out on the road, and who would appear in various forms on Flowers in the Dirt. Hamish Stuart was best known for his tenure in Average White Band, while Robbie McIntosh had been a member of The Pretenders. Filling out the sound would be Chris Whitten on drums and Paul Wickens joining McCartney's wife Linda McCartney on keyboards.\n\nFinally, early in 1989, the project was ready. In May, the Beatlesque &quot;My Brave Face&quot; was released as a single and promptly gave McCartney a US hit, reaching #25, while reaching #18 in the UK. In June, Flowers in the Dirt was released to high anticipation and immediately entered the UK charts at #1, garnering very receptive reviews from all around. In the US, the reaction was better than Press to Play, with the album reaching #21, staying on the charts for a year and going gold, though it still sold beneath expectations. The second single, &quot;This One&quot; reached #18 in the UK, as did &quot;My Brave Face&quot;. The follow-ups &quot;Figure Of Eight&quot;/&quot;OÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ est le Soleil ?&quot; and &quot;Put It There&quot; would all be minor UK hits.\n\nThe Paul McCartney World Tour opened on 26 September 1989 and would travel the globe (including Japan) until the following July, becoming one of the highest grossing and best reviewed tours of all time.\n\nThe album cover artwork was photographed by Linda McCartney. The background canvas was painted by the British artist Brian Clarke, who was also responsible for designing stage backdrops for the world tour.\n\nA limited-edition &quot;World Tour Pack&quot; of Flowers in the Dirt, sold in a facsimile trunk, was issued in Britain in October 1989, and America (with British catalogue numbers) in January 1990. The set included a bonus single of &quot;Party Party&quot; (Mixed by Bruce Forest and released on a one-sided 7&quot; single in vinyl editions of the &quot;World Tour Pack&quot; and a 3&quot; CD-single in compact disc editions of the &quot;World Tour Pack&quot;). In March 1990, another limited edition of the album that featured a bonus disc was released exclusively in Japan and re-entered the country's chart. A remastered CD was released in 1993.\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\n* Paul McCartney - vocals, acoustic guitar, bass, electric guitar, 12-string guitar, Mexican guitar, piano, synth, drums, tambourine, percussion, celeste, sitar, wine glasses, harmonium, background vocal, hand claps, finger snaps, mellotron, flugel horn, bongos, violin, keyboard, woodsaw\n* Linda McCartney - mini-moog, background vocals, hand claps\n* Robbie McIntosh - acoustic guitar, electric guitar\n* Hamish Stuart - electric guitar, acoustic guitar, bass, percussion, background vocal\n* Chris Whitten - drums, percussion, hand claps, synth drums\n* Paul &quot;Wix&quot; Wickens - keyboards\n* Elvis Costello - vocal, keyboards, background vocals\n* David Gilmour - guitar\n* David Foster - keyboards\n* Dave Mattacks - drums\n* Guy Barker - trumpet\n* Steve Lipson - bass, computer &amp; drum programming, electric guitar, keyboards\n* Peter Henderson - computer programming\n* Trevor Horn - keyboards, hand claps\n* Nicky Hopkins - piano\n* Mitchell Froom - keyboards\n* David Rhodes - e-bow guitar\n* Judd Lander - harmonica\n* Chris Davis - saxophone\n* Chris White - saxophone\n* Dave Bishop - saxophone\n* John Taylor - cornet\n* Tony Goddard - cornet\n* Ian Peters - euphonium\n* Ian Harper - tenor horn\n* Jab Bunny - tongue styley\n* Eddie Klien - additional computer programing\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowers_in_the_Dirt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowers_in_the_Dirt&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nSide 1:\n\n01.
