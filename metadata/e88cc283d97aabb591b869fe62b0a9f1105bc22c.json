This pack contains six scenarios using six separate locomotives and three different routes (Oxford to Paddington, Newcastle to York (Modern) &amp; WCML North) so this is almost certainly our most varied pack to date. These scenarios allow you to give these grand locomotives a good run out and the passing AI traffic offers realism, variety and interest through the use of various other locomotive and rolling stock packs.\n\nIn these scenarios, we have strived for realism in all areas. For example, each scenario is based on an actual railtour that has operated in reality and uses the timetable of its relevant year to create an as realistic experience as possible. As well as this, most trains have their time of leaving, origin and destination so you can see which train is which!\n\nRequirements\nExtra Stock \nJust Trains Newcastle to York (Modern) Route\nWest Coast Main Line \nDigital Traction Mk1s\nIron Horse House Duchess of Sutherland\nIron Horse House 7MT Britannia \nJust Trains Class 60 \nJust Trains Voyager \nJust Trains YGB Seacow PlusPak\nOovee TEA Bogie Tank Wagon Pack \nRS.com Class 37 Pack \nRS.com Green and Gold HST Pack \nRS.com Class 66 (Steam version)\n OR RSDL UK Wagon Pack 01 (imported from Rail Simulator) AND \nRS.com Class 66 (imported from Rail Simulator) - \nRS.com Class 158 \nRS.com Class 390 \nRS.com 8F Steam Locomotive \nRS.com Flying Scotsman Steam Locomotive \nRS.com GWR Hall Steam Locomotive \nRS.com Tornado Steam Locomotive ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e88cc283d97aabb591b869fe62b0a9f1105bc22c","amp;dn":"RailWorks+-+AP18%3A+Steam+Railtours+Scenario+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e88cc283d97aabb591b869fe62b0a9f1105bc22c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,140,194,131,217,122,171,181,145,184,105,254,98,176,169,241,16,91,194,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
