This encyclopedia provides a much needed authoritative and comprehensive coverage of the use of power in those different discourses, enabling the different language communities to learn from each other. It provides a compendium of the concepts that build the ways in which power is conceptualized and provides analyses of related concepts. It also provides a sourcebook for those interested in studying power, and it cross references the many insights that have been provided by theorists over the years. \nWith comprehensive coverage of the use of power in the social sciences, the encyclopedia serves as a one-stop point of reference for the diverse and complex ways in which power has been used. It also provides a reference for debates central to the issues of power in different contexts and for related topics, showing how these disparate topics are related to power.\n\nKey Themes\nBiography\nConcepts Related to Power\nDecisions and Game Theory\nInstitutional Issues\nInternational Relations\nInterpersonal Relationships\nIntrapersonal Matters\nKey Debates\nMethodological Issues\nPolitical Science\nPolitical Theory\nSocial Psychology\nSocial Theory\nTheories of Power\nTypes of Power\nUrban Studies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f86ae04af26c5baf423c1e8b221bf8d5d7919c9f","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Power","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f86ae04af26c5baf423c1e8b221bf8d5d7919c9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,106,224,74,242,108,91,175,66,60,30,139,34,27,248,213,215,145,156,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
