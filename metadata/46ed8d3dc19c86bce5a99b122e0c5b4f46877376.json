Don Diego is an idler who has never concerned himself with more than the cut of his clothes. Unlike other full-blooded youths of his age, he presents himself as a fop, lacking in vigor, vitality, and strength. But VegaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s timorous reputation is merely a mask to conceal his alter egoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½El Zorro. As Zorro, dressed in black and wearing a mask, he is transformed into a cunning swordsman who fearlessly pulls off dashing and daring escapades in his quest to avenge the helpless, aid the poor and oppressed, and punish cruel officials. Deemed an outlaw by CaliforniaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s corrupt governor, he is ever-hunted by the Commandante of La Reina de Los Angeles, Capitan RamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n, and his henchman, Sergeant Pedro Gonzalez.\n\nForced to find a wife or lose his inheritance, Diego sets off to romance the fiery, outspoken Lolita Pulido, the most beautiful seÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±orita in Los Angeles. Unimpressed with DiegoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s passionless efforts to win her affections, Lolita finds herself attracted to the dashing and courageous Zorro. With the Pulido family having been impoverished by the corrupt governor, her father would see her married to the rich Don Diego. At the same time, the nobly born but morally dissolute Captain RamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n has also taken an interest in the fair seÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±orita, making matters worse. As \ntensions heighten between RamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n and the Pulido family and pursuit of the masked avenger intensifies, Zorro leaves his mark on those who would perpetrate injustice.\n\nThe Mark of Zorro, masterfully adapted into a full-cast audio drama by the award-winning Hollywood Theater of the Ear especially for Blackstone Audio, is an exciting, action packed, swashbuckling adventure that will have listeners on the edge of their seats.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46ed8d3dc19c86bce5a99b122e0c5b4f46877376","amp;dn":"The+Mark+of+Zorro++%28Narrated+by+Val+Kilmer%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46ed8d3dc19c86bce5a99b122e0c5b4f46877376","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,237,141,61,193,156,134,188,229,169,155,18,46,12,91,79,70,135,115,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
