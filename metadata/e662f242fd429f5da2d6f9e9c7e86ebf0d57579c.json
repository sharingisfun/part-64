Ancient cave drawings of strange creatures, remains of landing strips in Peru, and Indian texts that describe the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œflying machines of the godsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ were just a few of the odd archaeological artifacts cited by von Daniken as proof that ancient astronauts were well known to our ancestors.\n\n\nProduced with the exclusive cooperation of von Daniken himself, ANCIENT ALIENS launches all-new expeditions to seek out and evaluate this evidence, with a concentration on discoveries of the last 30 years, including unusual DNA findings on manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s evolution and newly decoded artifacts from Egypt to Syria to South America. It is a balanced investigation into a theory some believe cannot be true, but many agree cannot be ignored.\n\n\n\n                \n\n\n\nTitle................: Ancient Aliens 1\nYear.................: 2010\nGenre................: Documentary \nVideo Length.........: 01:27:49 (  ) 01:27:57 Each\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........: 128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........: MPEG Layer-3 \nLanguage.............: English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.: 16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........: XviD \nVideo Resolution.....: 624x352 \nVIdeo Bitrate........: 1114 kbit/s ( ) 1158 kbits\n\n\nSubs.................: External English\nFile Size:...........: 699 MB ( ) 700 MB\nFPS..................: 29.976000\n\nChannel(s)...........: 2 channels\nRelease date.........: 2009-2010\nParts................: [5 Episodes + Pilot]\n\n\n \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1643266/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1643266/&lt;/a&gt;          (Season 1)\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1643266/episodes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1643266/episodes&lt;/a&gt;  (All Episodes/Seasons)\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1418108/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1418108/&lt;/a&gt;   Pilot: (Chariots, Gods and Beyond)\n\n\n\n\nEpisodes:\n=========\n\nPL:Chariots, Gods and Beyond (Pilot)\n1) The Evidence\n2) The Visitors\n3) The Mission\n4) Closer Encounters\n5) The Return\n\n\n\n[HDTV:]\n=======\n\n\n\n\nNote: External subtitles included.\n==================================\n\n\n \n \nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                     ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n=============\n\nAfter my account accidentally got deleted i had to restore it.However if you click \n\non DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT link it might not work for you.Use the magnet link(s) \n\ninstead,thank you.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e662f242fd429f5da2d6f9e9c7e86ebf0d57579c","amp;dn":"Ancient+Aliens+1-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e662f242fd429f5da2d6f9e9c7e86ebf0d57579c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,98,242,66,253,66,159,93,162,214,249,233,199,232,110,191,13,87,87,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
