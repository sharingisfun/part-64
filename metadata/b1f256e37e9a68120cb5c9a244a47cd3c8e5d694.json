Frank states he hasn't played guitar in three years! As far as I can determine, this CD was only released in Czechoslovakia (an import CD was also released in Japan later, I think). My CD seems to be an original Czechoslovak pressing as there is no additional Japanese insert and all the text is in Czechoslovak. I translated the song titles where appropriate with Google Translate. My apologies for any mistakes or missed nuances! There are a TON of punctuation marks in the song titles that can't be kept in a simple text file, so I included a RichText file with lots more info and correct song titles for your edification.\n\n\n And, as always, trade freely and NEVER SELL.\n\n Doctor Golgo\n August 19, 2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1f256e37e9a68120cb5c9a244a47cd3c8e5d694","amp;dn":"Prazsky+Vyber+-+Adieu+C.A.+with+Frank+Zappa+%281992%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1f256e37e9a68120cb5c9a244a47cd3c8e5d694","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,242,86,227,126,154,104,18,12,181,201,162,68,164,124,211,200,229,214,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
