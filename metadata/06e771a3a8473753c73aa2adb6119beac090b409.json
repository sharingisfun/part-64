The Search Engine distills the best parts from three EPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worth of material into a continuous 56 minute album of unbridled creativity and laser-sharp focus. Collaborations abound in the form of vocal appearances from Natural Self (aka Nathaniel Pearn), JG Thirlwell (Foetus, Steroid Maximus etc.) and The The's Matt Johnson. The latter reprises his vocal on a cover of his own track GIANT, nearly thirty years after its first release. Musical hook-ups include 2econd Class Citizen, who trades sample-attacks with Strictly for the suite of nine tracks that make up the 11 minute Magpie Music. Dr Rubberfunk lends his drumming skills to the opening track and old DJ Food partner PC and Solid Steel's DK add their own ingredients to the mix. Perhaps the biggest surprise of all to those who associate the DJ Food name with the early 90s Jazz Brakes records is just how heavy The Search Engine is. Styled as a kind of psychedelic rock album made with samplers, Strictly Kev has not been afraid the frug the fuck out, with thundering drum work and fuzz bass perhaps the central muscial signature of the work.\n\nTracklisting :\n01.
