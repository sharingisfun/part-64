The Tyranids are an alien\nrace, threatening the imperium from the edge of the galaxy,\nliving only to feast upon the flesh of their foes. They are\na fearsome adversary, but an even better ally! That's why\nour mod allows you fight with and for the great Tyranid race,\nswarm the enemy with hundreds of hormagaunts, stamp on your\nfoes with the huge carnifex and devour your opponent from\nwithin with the deadly lictor. We aim to show players of Dawn\nof War what the fantastic Tyranids are and attempt to keep as\ntrue to the feel of the race as possible.\n\nTyranids 0.5b1 Release\n--------------------\n\n+HOW DO I INSTALL IT?+\n\nSimple run the installer!
