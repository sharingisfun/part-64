In principle I do not totally agree with the used methods but I simply could not resist the opportunity and built a MP3 Pop (plus) Database for my granddaughter called &quot;The day before you came&quot;. \n\nWhile collecting I compiled some playlists. Including the best (sounding) MP3 files ranging from Blues to Indie and from Jazz to Metal (avoiding some disturbing noise). After finalising an Indie Top 100+1 (Play in Reverse) I had the feeling the set (50 + 1) was more or less complete (and honour the involved artists).\n\nYes IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a freeloader (too).... and now its time to do something back. So I named the set ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDutch TreatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and gave it back to the Web. However,  I cannot seed it for ever and I closed my Torrents after a while, disappointing people looking for some missing parts. Therefore one Torrent was created that includes the whole set and will be available until 10 complete copies are uploaded. So it very much depends on you whether other people can get a complete copy too. So make an exception this time.\n\nAnother reason to publicise these lists, I found in the changing music world itself.  The technique has grown up and large machinery (and companies) to organize the pop-business is no longer needed. This gives rise to a new mainstream, now called Indie (from Independent) and will have some major impact.\n\nFor instance in location (studio to home) and sound (studio - privately used equipment). That means more time to concentrate on the music and more time to concentrate on the words.  A bit like it was when Rock &amp; Roll Music started to make an impact. \n\nThe tone has changed though. From complaining and protesting, to explaining and story telling (clean, tight, self convidenced and target conscious). If I am not mistaken, Rock &amp; Roll music has matured into a new inspiring (and hope giving) phase. Just like we felt the first time in the sixties. A bit like the son of Sting (in Fiction Plane). The song &quot;Play in Reverse&quot; from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLex LandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sais it all. It has become my new &quot;Yesterday&quot;.\n\nAll compilations are 100% clean HQ VBR MP3 files. Fully labelled and include a nice picture (from the web) I use as a folder. Enjoy and consider buying for true sound quality and support.\n\nCompilations:\n\n000 Play in Reverse (Indie Top 100 + 1)\n001 2 X (11+4) (Top 11 + 4 pairs)\n002 The Trip (Folk, Pop)\n003 Street Scenes (Easy Jazz)\n004 The Cinema Show (Tribute to Symphonic Rock)\n005 Tuff Puzzle  (Jazz, Blues)\n006 Brother (easy Listening)\n007 Onderweg (Dutch)\n008 Yesterday (Pop)\n009 Like A Star (Pop)\n010 One Word (Dutch Artists)\n011 Como La Vida (World Italy)\n012 Truth (Easy Listening)\n013 Precious (Pop)\n014 Two Faces (Easy Listening)\n015 Mandela (Easy Jazz)\n016 Touch (Easy Pop)\n017 Wonderland (Pop)\n018 Smile (Pop)\n019 Live Goes On (Old school Rap)\n020 Full Circle (Rock)\n021 57 Channels (Blues)\n022 Come On Home (Easy Jazz)\n023 M'n Hart Gevolgd (Easy Pop)\n024 Peculiar (Easy Pop)\n025 Pieces (Jazzy Pop)\n026 Heartbeats (Acoustic Pop)\n027 I Count Shapes (Indie)\n028 Light (Electronic, Indie)\n029 So Nice (Easy Jazz)\n030 One (Jazzy Pop)\n031 From Sarah (Love Songs from a Sarah)\n032 The Sign Of Fire (Indie)\n033 Tere Bina (World India)\n034 Here With Me (Pop)\n035 After The Storm (Indie)\n036 Fire Of Love (Pop)\n037 N'dokh (Water) (World Africa)\n038 Soap &amp; Water (Jazzy Pop)\n039 Blue Eyes (Pop, R&amp;B, Rap)\n040 Io Canto (World Italy)\n041 Something (World Lounge)\n042 Passion (Exotic Pop)\n043 Fimani (World Africa)\n044 African (World Africa)\n045 Circle (Pop)\n046 Con La Musica (World Italy)\n047 Radar Love (Metal)\n048 Animals (Rock, Pop)\n049 Candy (Pre school Indie)\n050 Time Flies (Indie Porcupine Tree Special)\n\nPlus Play in Reverse (Indie Top 100 Mai 1911)\n\nOther additional playlists are still available","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06b7ca1c6e7360f451f7e473adf3f74c323fb19b","amp;dn":"Dutch+Treat+-+First+Series+01-50+%28Various+Barproof+Music+HQ+MP3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06b7ca1c6e7360f451f7e473adf3f74c323fb19b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,183,202,28,110,115,96,244,81,247,228,115,173,243,247,76,50,63,177,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
