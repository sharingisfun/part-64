Curtis Taylor, Jr., a car salesman, breaks into the music business with big dreams. He signs a trio of young women, the Dreamettes, gets them a job backing an R&amp;B performer, James &quot;Thunder&quot; Early, establishes his own record label and starts wheeling and dealing. When Early flames out, Curtis makes the Dreamettes into headliners as the Dreams, but not before demoting their hefty big-voiced lead singer, Effie White, and putting the softer-voiced looker, Deena Jones, in front. Soon after, he fires Effie, sends her into a life of proud poverty, and takes Deena and the Dreams to the top. How long can Curtis stay there, and will Effie ever get her due?\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443489/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443489/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f00f53574bee1850b76e0dd59869e96fc1431784","amp;dn":"Dreamgirls+%282006%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f00f53574bee1850b76e0dd59869e96fc1431784","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,15,83,87,75,238,24,80,183,110,13,213,152,105,233,111,193,67,23,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
