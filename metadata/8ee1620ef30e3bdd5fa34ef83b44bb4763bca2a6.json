From The Duke Ellington Orchestra to Luther Allison, the late Blues Guitar Women to the No-Name local heroes, from Charlie Parker to Stan Webb\\'s Chicken Shack - they all have been there. \n\nSurrounded by a beautiful parc, and hosted by the Druid of Jazz and Blues himself, Claude Lentz (and now his son Benji), they created a magic environment where they sell their own beer, host musicians and invite to their yearly Jazz- and Blues Festival.\n\nIn 2000, Bobby Watson recorded this excellent compilation live at the Ferme Madelonne.\nTrack #5 (Blues for Claude) is dedicated to Claude Lentz, for his lifetime work in hosting and welcoming musicians from around the globe.\n\nFiles come in 320 kbps.\n\n1. Confirmation (Charlie Parker) - 11:16\n2. All Blues (Miles Davis ) - 15:23\n3. The shadow of your smile (Johnny Mandel) - 11:05\n4. Cherokee (Ray Noble) - 11:51\n5. Blues for Claude (Bobby Watson) - 8:20\n6. The theme ( Miles Davis) - 3:45\n\nFiles in 320 kbps\n\nEnjoy, seed - and visit the Ferme Madelonne. Gouvy is groovy :o)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ee1620ef30e3bdd5fa34ef83b44bb4763bca2a6","amp;dn":"In+the+groove","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ee1620ef30e3bdd5fa34ef83b44bb4763bca2a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,225,98,14,243,14,59,221,95,163,78,248,59,68,187,71,99,188,162,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
