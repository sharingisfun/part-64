His facility and relaxation, especially in the 1950s, were able to make the baritone feel like a delicately handled tenor. But his tone (thanks to the Tristano influence detectable in many Swedish and German musicians of this period) was so light and pure that it recalled not so much a tenor as altoist Lee Konitz  Local commentators detect the inspiration not only of folk-music but the 19th-century Swedish composers in Gullins distinctive writing.\nJazz, the Essential Companion; Paladin, London 1987\n\nJack Kerouac on Lars Gullin:\na whole case of longplayed bop albums, and first Wig plays Stan Getz and the Swedish group with Bengt Hallberg on piano, the marvelous Lars Gullin on baritone, great rhythm section - first music I'd heard in months.\n\nChet Baker on Lars Gullin:\nThe only baritone player that I was aware of was Gerry Mulligan. When I heard Lars, I thought, Jesus, there is another way of playing the baritone! Lars played with a lot more fire and a lot more authority in some ways than Gerry did.\nPrivate interview by PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r Rittsel\n\nLeonard Feather on Lars Gullin:\nIf he ever decides to emigrate to this country, I might add, he is going to scare a lot of people, make a lot of records and gain a lot of admirers.\n\n- - -\n\nLars Gullin - Lars Gullin Vol. 2, 1953 Modern sounds\n(Stockholm Dragon 1993)\n\n 1.
