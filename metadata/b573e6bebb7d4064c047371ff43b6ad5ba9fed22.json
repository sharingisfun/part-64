In describing the stages of the virus, McDonald said: &quot;There are three stages to this virus. The first stage is you might begin to repeat a word. Something gets stuck. And usually it's words that are terms of endearment, like sweetheart or honey. The second stage is your language becomes scrambled and you can't express yourself properly. The third stage is that you become so distraught at your condition that the only way out of the situation you feel, as an infected person, is to try and chew your way through the mouth of another person&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226681/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226681/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b573e6bebb7d4064c047371ff43b6ad5ba9fed22","amp;dn":"PontyPool+%282008%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b573e6bebb7d4064c047371ff43b6ad5ba9fed22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,115,230,190,187,125,64,100,192,71,55,31,244,59,106,213,186,159,237,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
