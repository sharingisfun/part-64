The duo consists of musicians Nick Littlemore (vocals, production) and Peter Mayes (guitar, production). The pair have achieved multiple successes throughout their career with their award-winning debut album Sambanova, their universally acclaimed 2008 release Pnau, their breakthrough side-project Empire of the Sun, and their multiple chart-topping singles. Pnau is also recognized for their heavily publicized apprenticeship under musician Elton John, who signed the duo after listening to their record Pnau. A number of projects featuring Elton's involvement with the band are currently in development, such as Pnau's new album Soft Universe and an album featuring Pnau recreations of Elton John's hits.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89caff40999135cfb13f1edec45d6ed7fac3fab3","amp;dn":"Pnau+-+Discography+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89caff40999135cfb13f1edec45d6ed7fac3fab3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,202,255,64,153,145,53,207,177,63,30,222,196,93,110,215,250,195,250,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
