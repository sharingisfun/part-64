Lemonhead and Jay Ski, the genre might have become more than a hokey cul-de-sac off hip-hop road. The Jacksonville, FL, production team of Lemonhead and Ski were responsible not only for the anthems &quot;Whoot (There It Is)&quot; and &quot;Tootsie Roll&quot; (as 95 South and 69 Boyz, respectively), but they also struck platinum with Quad City DJ's' &quot;C'mon n' Ride It (The Train).&quot; One of the biggest singles of 1996, the song was a relentlessly catchy workout full of witty, shoutable lyrical couplets. Just as the duo's previous triumphs had, &quot;C'mon n' Ride It&quot; extricated the raunch from bass music, but retained and even expanded on the booty-shaking rhythms, almost to cartoonish proportions. While &quot;C'mon n' Ride It&quot; was a success as a single, applying its formula to a bankable album was a trickier prospect. Lemonhead and Ski didn't necessarily succeed with Get on up and Dance -- it suffers from repetition, and nothing is as undeniably catchy as the single. But as nothing more than a party record, Get on Up is a harmless, humorous, and entertaining diversion. &quot;Work Baby Work (The Prep)&quot; is almost a dub plate of &quot;C'mon n' Ride It,&quot; &quot;Summer Jam&quot; reinterprets the summery piano line of Sister Sledge's &quot;We Are Family&quot; over a rap that cops the meter of &quot;Tootsie Roll,&quot; and &quot;Hey DJ&quot; steals Ready for the World's &quot;Love You Down&quot; (just as INOJ later would for her So So Def-affiliated single &quot;Love You Down&quot;). Hovering at an average of 132 beats per minute, Get on up and Dance also never makes the mistake of including a ballad or an unfunny skit. It's all about dancing, all the time. Two &quot;C'mon n' Ride It&quot; remixes close out the party on a familiar and fun note.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d2748c9677fcaee420e20b4f55b1fa3e912401d","amp;dn":"Quad+City+DJ%5C%27s+--+Get+on+up+and+Dance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d2748c9677fcaee420e20b4f55b1fa3e912401d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,39,72,201,103,127,202,238,66,14,32,180,245,91,31,163,233,18,64,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
