The main characters were - Herman Munster (the father) is a representation of Frankenstein's monster and is a funeral parlor employee, Lily (his wife) is a lady vampire, Count Dracula (Grandpa &amp; Lily's father) is a 378-year-old mad scientist and vampire, Eddie Wolfgang (their 10-year-old son) is a werewolf. Marilyn (their niece) is the only normal one and is considered the ugly duckling of the family, and Spot, the family pet (a fire-breathing dinosaur who lived under the stairs). Plenty of laughs were provided as the group of misfits attempted to assimilate themselves into society, although most of the chuckles were to be found at the gag-fuelled ghouls' highly gothic-looking residence, 1313 Mockingbird Lane. \n\nFirst 4 episodes\n1.3GB\nExcellent picture quality even on a big screen TV.\n\nStill to come Episodes 5_8","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:737c458b9e867148216de9756874e315ebeccd6c","amp;dn":"The+Munsters+1_4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"737c458b9e867148216de9756874e315ebeccd6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,124,69,139,158,134,113,72,33,109,233,117,104,116,227,21,235,236,205,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
