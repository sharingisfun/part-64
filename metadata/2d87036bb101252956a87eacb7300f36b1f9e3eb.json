The music of Depeche Mode, Kraftwerk and New Order that kick started AndyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own EDM odyssey way back in the 90ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s.\n\nFor a producer and DJ used to delivering epic club moments, it would have been the easy option to throw together a bunch of club tracks and call it an album without much thought to the bigger picture but thankfully The Space Between The Stars doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t go that route. The 15 brand new tracks are meticulously crafted, unique and diverse productions that take you on a spacey journey through the abstract mind, the electronic soul and right to the beating heart of one of EDMÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s stalwart artists.\n\nFrom the opening, rocket-fuelled-launch of Trance opener Voyager, the beautiful, melancholy collaboration with Molly Bancroft on In Deep to the cool chill of Cold Love and Sunrays from US singer/songwriter Manya and the Mike Koglin co-write Chemistry, the evolution from his Cloudwalking days are obvious. The house and techno feel of Altitudes, I Dream Of Stars and Jaywalker couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be further away from his Trance classics like My Religion and InsigmaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Open Our Eyes but somehow that inimitable Pulser sound is retained, becoming more evident in the uplifting heights of the clubby DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Look Down, the title track The Space Between the Stars and beyond into the pop-trance collaboration with the rising stars of British Electropop Blacktzar on By Your Side.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d87036bb101252956a87eacb7300f36b1f9e3eb","amp;dn":"Pulser+-+The+Space+Between+The+Stars+%282011%29%28Trance%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d87036bb101252956a87eacb7300f36b1f9e3eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,135,3,107,177,1,37,41,86,168,126,172,183,48,15,54,177,249,227,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
