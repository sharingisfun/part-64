Development focuses on simplicity, minimalism, and code elegance. Arch is installed as a minimal base system, configured by the user upon which their own ideal environment is assembled by installing only what is required or desired for their unique purposes. GUI configuration utilities are not officially provided, and most system configuration is performed from the shell by editing simple text files. Based on a rolling-release model, Arch strives to stay bleeding edge, and typically offers the latest stable versions of most software.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.archlinux.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.archlinux.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.archlinux.org/download/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.archlinux.org/download/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Main_Page&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Main_Page&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2430605fce87cf10e20f0c6036c2e5896005a13c","amp;dn":"Arch+Linux+Netinstall+Image+Dual+Architecture","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2430605fce87cf10e20f0c6036c2e5896005a13c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,48,96,95,206,135,207,16,226,15,12,96,54,194,229,137,96,5,161,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
