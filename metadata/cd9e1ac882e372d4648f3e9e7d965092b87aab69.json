WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re releasing 4 Editions this time. For those who are new to Simplicity Linux, or those who are just a bit confused about what to download, here is a quick guide to what is what!\n\nSimplicity Linux Media Edition 11.7\nMedia Edition is a release we are really excited about. After seeing Google TV at Google IO this year, we decided to see what we could do with Simplicity and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Puppy Linux base. The result is Simplicity Linux Media Edition. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s still a little rough around the edges, but it gets the job done. We actually have an old laptop connected to a 22ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â³ monitor in the office which runs Media Edition for watching movies and listening to music. Combined with a wireless keyboard and mouse, Media Edition could make an old computer into a great lounge computer.\n\nHome Page :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://simplicitylinux.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://simplicitylinux.org/&lt;/a&gt;\nSupport Page : \nIdenit.ca Page :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://identi.ca/simplicitylinux&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://identi.ca/simplicitylinux&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd9e1ac882e372d4648f3e9e7d965092b87aab69","amp;dn":"Simplicity1107Media.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd9e1ac882e372d4648f3e9e7d965092b87aab69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,158,26,200,130,227,114,212,100,143,62,158,125,150,80,146,184,122,171,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
