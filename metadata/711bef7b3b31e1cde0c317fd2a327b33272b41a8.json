Champions United twice \nbeat Arsenal at Old Trafford last season, in the league and FA Cup, and have strengthened their squad in the \nsummer with the big-money additions of David de Gea, Ashley Young and Phil Jones. By contrast, Arsenal \nendured a turbulent off-season, with the futures of unsettled pair Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri dominating \nthe headlines. However, the Gunners deservedly beat United when they last met in May. Tottenham are unbeaten \nat home to Manchester City since 2003, but were usurped in the top four by Roberto Mancini's side last season. \nAmbitious City have again spent big this summer as they seek to win the league title. There are also highlights \nfrom the Hawthorns, where West Brom take on Stoke, and action from St James' Park, the venue for Newcastle's \nmatch against Fulham.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:711bef7b3b31e1cde0c317fd2a327b33272b41a8","amp;dn":"Match+Of+The+Day+-+2+-+28+August+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"711bef7b3b31e1cde0c317fd2a327b33272b41a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,27,239,123,59,49,225,205,224,195,23,253,42,50,123,51,39,43,65,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
