Serpico's experiences as a police officer were dramatized in the 1973 film Serpico, which starred Al Pacino in the lead role. \n\nAlex also welcomes Richard Reeves in studio to talk about Ron Paul's presidential campaign and how you can get involved with local issues in your community. \n\nRegular Friday guest Bob Chapman also makes an appearance to discuss gold hitting new all time records as the stock market plunges and the economy continues to decline. \n\nIn a full 4th hour overDrive Alex and Richard Reeves talk with Robert Morrow (Ron Paul supporter and Perry critic), who has run an ad asking &quot;Have you ever had sex with Rick Perry&quot; seeking strippers/escorts/&quot;hotties&quot; or gay men who've had sexual encounters with Perry and are willing to help expose Perry's hypocrisy.\n[see CASH_ad.jpg included in torrent]\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
