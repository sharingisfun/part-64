Oskar (Thomas Horn) is convinced that his father (Tom Hanks), who died in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center, has left a final message for him hidden somewhere in the city. Feeling disconnected from his grieving mother (Sandra Bullock) and driven by a relentlessly active mind that refuses to believe in things that canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be observed, Oskar begins searching New York City for the lock that fits a mysterious key he found in his fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s closet. His journey through the five boroughs takes him beyond his own loss to a greater understanding of the observable world around him. \n\nGenre: Drama \nIMDB rating: 6.4/10 (3,379 users) \nDirected by: Stephen Daldry \nStarring: Thomas Horn, Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock \n\nRelease Name: Extremely.Loud.Incredibly.Close.2011.DVD.SCREENER.XviD-PADDO \nSize: 1.4 GB \nVideo: XViD | 640ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€272 | 1 343 Kbps \nAudio: English | AC3 | 384 Kbps \nRuntime: 130 minutes \n\n\n                             &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4005d6e8e5c54515accca5fc083cdb40aee7809c","amp;dn":"Extremely+Loud+Incredibly+Close+2011+DVD+SCREENER+XviD-PADDO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4005d6e8e5c54515accca5fc083cdb40aee7809c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,5,214,232,229,197,69,21,172,204,165,252,8,60,219,64,174,231,128,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
