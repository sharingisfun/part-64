The book also covers a number of research trends that are still being developed, such as the development of micromechanical damage models, micromechanical analysis of fracture mechanisms and criteria, damage modelling of free surface and interface elements, methods of predicting anistropy induced by large strains in the forming process, quantitative characterization of microscale damage and straining effects, and computer methods for estimation of residual strength of damaged structures or the fatigue limit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f455107a0ce3c2c5045211c44eb33bac195eef1d","amp;dn":"Prediction+of+Defects+in+Material+Processing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f455107a0ce3c2c5045211c44eb33bac195eef1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,85,16,122,12,227,194,197,4,82,17,196,78,179,59,172,25,94,239,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
