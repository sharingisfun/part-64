Reboot into safe mode if\n        you still have problems.  Copy roboform.dll into AI Roboform\\'s\n        installed folder, making sure to overwrite the existing file.  AI\n        Roboform is now in the full PRO version with Enterprise features.\n \n        Included is the Enterprise policies tool with this release so you\n        don\\'t need to request it from the homepage.  Its located in the\n        PolicyEditor folder.\n \n        Feel free to use the online sync feature, it does work fine when\n        you run the setup.  Also make sure to set it up later or a\n        taskbar notification will let you know once.  This is also known\n        as RoboForm Everywhere which is fully functional in this release.\n        Its suggested to use a different RoboForm Everywhere password\n        than your master password.  This way nobody will be able to\n        decrypt your online database except you.\n\n        Note that you can now choose either Everywhere or Desktop type of\n        installation while first installing AI Roboform.  You can also\n        tell which type of configuration its currently set at by opening\n        the About window.  Everywhere will show Sync With [USERNAME],\n        while Desktop will not show Sync.  This can be changed at any\n        time by going into Options then User Data and clicking on\n        Settings button.\n \n        Thats it!  Enjoy.\n\n\n------------------\n\nAll credits and thanks goes to TE for keeping us UPtoDATE!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97c4699ed40bbfa736a28a99eb58d61360de0221","amp;dn":"AI+Roboform+Enterprise+v7.4.2+TE+%28Firefox+6+ready%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97c4699ed40bbfa736a28a99eb58d61360de0221","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,196,105,158,212,11,191,167,54,162,138,153,235,88,214,19,96,222,2,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
