It is considered his most successful.\n\nThe novel's form is unusual in that there is no traditional narrative voice, one of the primary features of fiction. It is written in large part as dialogue, without any indication of who is speaking, except for a dash (-) to show a change of speaker. There are also parts of stream of consciousness. What is not written as dialogue or stream of consciousness is written as metafictional government documentation. The conversations between the characters, when not focused on the moment at hand, are recountings of films that Molina has seen, which act as a form of escape from their environment. Thus there are a main plot, several subplots, and five additional stories that comprise the novel.\n\nKiss of the Spider Woman (Portuguese: O Beijo da Mulher Aranha) is a 1985 Brazilian-American drama film. It was directed by Argentine-born Brazilian director HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ctor Babenco, and adapted by Leonard Schrader from the Manuel Puig novel of the same name. William Hurt, RaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºl JuliÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡, Sonia Braga, Jose Lewgoy, and Milton Goncalves star in the leading roles.\n\nTangled Web: Making Kiss of the Spider Woman (Video 2008)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1357527/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1357527/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nA strange odyssey from novel to film is chronicled in Tangled Web: Making Kiss of the Spider Woman.
