It seems she expresses that fish-out-of-water state of being universally acknowledged by all thinking human beings plagued with emptiness. Yet this is not a blues-based music, but a folkish, introspective, storytelling type of sound so deeply ingrained that only she can express or experience it. Playing mainly acoustic, or occasionally electric guitar while singing, Miles has a crystal-clear approach to these songs, with little or no mystery involved, but instead a definite message of solitude within isolation. In a distant viewpoint, songs like &quot;Map of My Heart,&quot; replete with echo and reverb guitar, the rambling &quot;I'm the Moon,&quot; with a reference to a cheap hotel, and the faux denial of &quot;Over You&quot; as she's heading for New Mexico, show Miles in an escapist mood. There's a more hopeful sentiment in spoken phrases during &quot;When My Ship Comes In&quot; and the midtempo &quot;All I Ever Wanted,&quot; while Miles plays harmonica for &quot;Eight Hour Drive,&quot; even sounding Bob Dylan-ish during the more connected &quot;Flames of Love.&quot; On occasion she puts aside the guitar for a piano, in Joni Mitchell-type reflection for &quot;The People You Love&quot; or &quot;You're Not Coming Back.&quot; Honest to a fault, Lynn Miles wears her heart on her sleeve 100-percent of the time in a frequently painful but forthright musical portrayal of her soul.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/02/19/lynn-miles/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c958fe9ae9032a86811bad8766c45e82ae34fe5e","amp;dn":"Lynn+Miles...Black+Flowers+Volume+1-2%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c958fe9ae9032a86811bad8766c45e82ae34fe5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,88,254,154,233,3,42,134,129,27,173,135,102,196,94,130,174,52,254,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
