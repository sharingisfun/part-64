House refused to testify last month in Alexandria, Virginia, before a grand jury hearing on WikiLeaks and the disclosure of thousands of classified U.S. diplomatic cables. Democracy Now! spoke to House at the Frontline Club in London about the significance of WikiLeaks, how he helped found the Bradley Manning Support Network, his visits with Manning at the Quantico Marine base in Virginia, the federal surveillance he and his associates have come under, and his experience before the grand jury. &quot;In my mind, this reeks of the Pentagon Papers investigation,&quot; says House. &quot;Richard Nixon's [Department of Justice] 40 years ago attempted to curtail the freedoms of the press and politically regulate the press through the use of policy created around the espionage investigation of The New York Times. I feel that the WikiLeaks case we have going on now provides Obama's DOJ ample opportunity to continue this attempt to politically regulate the U.S. media.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:734de964a00127589c0975420bff41510e317c52","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+11+jul+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"734de964a00127589c0975420bff41510e317c52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,77,233,100,160,1,39,88,156,9,117,66,11,255,65,81,14,49,124,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
