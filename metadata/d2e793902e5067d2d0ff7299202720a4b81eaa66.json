It is strictly game audio. Don't worry, you won't hear any stupid commentary or anything. Just straight-up in-game sound.\n\nI start the recording immediately after the briefing at the start of the case, so the first part you hear is me on my way out of the police station. The recording comes in at a little over an hour.\n\nHappy trails. And BTW, if anyone does actually download this and use it for some purpose, please leave a comment and let me know what you used this for. I'm really quite curious.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2e793902e5067d2d0ff7299202720a4b81eaa66","amp;dn":"LA+Noire+-+Manifest+Destiny+-+Gameplay+Audio+%28AAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2e793902e5067d2d0ff7299202720a4b81eaa66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,231,147,144,46,80,103,210,208,255,114,153,32,39,32,164,184,30,170,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
