I know many of you are asking\nwhat the fuck is this thing. Well let just say it is the tool which is at least\ntwice as efficient as normal x264 using low bitrates. This mean that even if you\ncould find better looking encodes, the QEBS encodes will have at least a class\nbetter looking quality than anything else in similar size. Developing QEBS is not\neasy and yes during each revision progress not all our choices were good and you\ncould not be satisfied with the quality in certain areas. To test our progress\nwe need to reencode the same movies over and over again and that is why we again\ngive you the same movie TRON, but this time reencoded with our new engine, which\nprogressed so much, that we decided to give him so much higher number 5.0 and\nstart to differ our new releases created with it by using QEBS5 in the name.\nWanna know how good the video commpression can be, check this out\n\nCheck out the new instruction for fixing your player problemms.\nRegards to all encoders especially Big thanx to Atom, FLAWL3SS and FraMeSToR crew\n, Filix, Rok3r, Kempas, Stun, Askeen, Faolanscath and all who likes my work.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed6031e2e2d612083570a50ba72fee4bdba4fb7c","amp;dn":"DEATH+RACE+2008+540p+BluRay+QEBS5+AAC20+ANDROID+IPAD+MP4-FASM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed6031e2e2d612083570a50ba72fee4bdba4fb7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,96,49,226,226,214,18,8,53,112,165,11,167,47,238,75,219,164,251,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
