This book will be\n found helpful by everyone who wishes to develop his own sparse matrix software, or who is using it and wishes to understand better how it operates,\n or who is planning to acquire a sparse matrix package and wishes to improve his understanding of the subject. Teachers who need an elementary\n presentation of sparse matrix methods and ideas and many examples of application at a professiona11eve1, will find such material in this book.\n Chapter 1 covers all fundamental material such as storage schemes, basic definitions and computational techniques needed for sparse matrix technology.\n It is very convenient to read at least Sections 1 to 9 and Section 12 of chapter 1 first","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:644237db41754494e4299bc6c0dfffd3fbeb9050","amp;dn":"Sparse+Matrix+Technology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"644237db41754494e4299bc6c0dfffd3fbeb9050","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,66,55,219,65,117,68,148,228,41,155,198,192,223,255,211,251,235,144,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
