It is nearly impossible to find torrent files that include all the extras or even important commentaries.\nThese files are from my collection of DVDs that I have made from rented movies over the last seven years or so.\nNearly all of them have been put onto a DVD5, so unfortunately I do not have an uncompressed source handy.  That said I can assure you that these look GREAT on larger screens.\nI chose to make them this size for economy as DVD9s were $3 each when I started this and DVD5s were .25 cents each.\nNow I am working on putting some of the best ones on a hard drive to be played with my HD TV Media Player and am still thinking economy is the best rule as these are half the size of ripping a DVD9.\nThis is the best quality for the value.\n\nI would love some productive feedback  . . .   :)\n\nThis is a DVD rip to an ISO; you can watch it on your media player, mount it to a virtual drive or burn it to a DVD.\n\nThis file includes EVERYTHING the original DVD has:\n\n1954\n124 minutes\nBlack and White\n1.33:1 \nSpoken Language: Japanese\nSubtitles: English\nAudio commentary by Japanese-literature professor Jeffrey Angles\nNew video interviews with critic Tadao Sato, assistant director Tokuzo Tanaka, and legendary actress Kyoko Kagawa on the making of the film and its lasting importance\nNew and improved English subtitle translation\n\nSYNOPSIS:  When an idealistic governor disobeys the reigning feudal lord, he is cast into exile, his wife and children left to fend for themselves and eventually wrenched apart by vicious slave traders. Under Kenji MizoguchiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dazzling direction, this classic Japanese story became one of cinemaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest masterpieces, a monumental, empathetic expression of human resilience in the face of evil.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b39ddde06202714dfae5b53b19922d8ce14d54d","amp;dn":"Sansho+The+Bailiff+%281954%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b39ddde06202714dfae5b53b19922d8ce14d54d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,57,221,222,6,32,39,20,223,174,91,83,177,153,34,216,206,20,213,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
