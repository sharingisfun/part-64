But a year later, in December of 1973, two American astronauts were sent on a secret mission to the moon funded by the US Department of Defense. What you are about to see is the actual footage which the astronauts captured on that mission. While NASA denies its authenticity, others say it's the real reason we've never gone back to the moon.\n\nGenre: Horror, Science Fiction, Thriller\n\nDirector: Gonzalo Lopez-Gallego\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nVideo: Xvid 1920x1080 23.98fps\n\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 320kbps\n___________________________________________________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:079d294848f4e8b798fef69a4967810da54258c0","amp;dn":"Apollo+18.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%232+%5BHD%5D+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"079d294848f4e8b798fef69a4967810da54258c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,157,41,72,72,244,232,183,152,254,246,154,73,103,129,13,165,66,88,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
