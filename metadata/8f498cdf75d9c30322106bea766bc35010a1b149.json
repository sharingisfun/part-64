Noxeema sees herself as the next Dorothy Dandridge, who bucked the trend of most black American movie actresses of her time by never playing the slave house maid. Vida's style reflects her past of growing up in upper class suburban Pennsylvania. One of their fellow New York contestants, Chi-Chi Rodriguez, is a straight-talking but naive and inexperienced drag queen. Seeing that Chi-Chi needs some drag queen confidence (despite her bravada), Vida and a reluctant Noxeema decide to cash in their plane tickets and buy an older model Cadillac convertible and drive to Hollywood with Chi-Chi. Their drive takes them through much of the country where alternate lifestyles are less tolerated than they may be in New York or Los Angeles... \nWritten by Huggo  - IMDB\n\nTitle: To_Wong_Foo_Thanks_for_Everything_DVD9\nSize: 6.34 Gb - DVD-9\nEnabled regions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\nPlay Length: 01:43:44\n  Video: PAL 16:9 (720x576) VBR, Auto Letterboxed\n  Audio:\n      English (Dolby AC3, 6 ch)\n      Russian (Dolby AC3, 2 ch)\nSubtitles: English, Russian, Dansk, Nederlands, Suomi, Svenska, Norsk, Latvian, Lithuanian, Estonian, Islenska\n      Menus - russian!\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f498cdf75d9c30322106bea766bc35010a1b149","amp;dn":"To+Wong+Foo+Thanks+for+Everything%2C+Julie+Newmar+%281995%29+DVD9+ENG+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f498cdf75d9c30322106bea766bc35010a1b149","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,73,140,223,117,217,195,3,34,16,107,234,118,107,195,80,16,161,177,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
