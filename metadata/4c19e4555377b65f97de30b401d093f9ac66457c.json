Despite this it's hard not to like it, because it has been executed so well here once more. The loose hand-held camera work and the gritty low key performances from it's cast make the film dark and believable. It shows that by casting good actors and setting your story in an unfamiliar place, there is still a lot of fun to be had in the cat n mouse genre. The film has been scored really well, and it uses the music well throughout, with some it's most effective moments set to it's thumping soundtrack. The film ends on a cliffhanger of sorts, and although I enjoyed the film I don't think it warrants a sequel and I hope that Alema moves on to a new projects and doesn't try to franchise this.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1543459/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1543459/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c19e4555377b65f97de30b401d093f9ac66457c","amp;dn":"War+Games%3A+At+The+End+Of+The+Day+%282010%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c19e4555377b65f97de30b401d093f9ac66457c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,25,228,85,83,119,182,95,151,222,48,180,1,208,147,249,172,102,69,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
