The team losing the opening tap will put the ball into play at their opponentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s end line at the beginning of the second and third quarters.\nIn putting the ball into play, the thrower-in may run along the end line or pass it to a teammate who is also out-of-bounds at the end line--as after a score.\n- Any player who engages in a fight is subject to a fine of $10,000 and a suspension.\nThis went into effect March 7, 1977. \n \n\n\n!!!!AFTER DOWNLOAD, PLEASE SEED!!!!
