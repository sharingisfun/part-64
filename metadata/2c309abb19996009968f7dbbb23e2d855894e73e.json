Balasubramanyam, Jackie Shroff, Pooja Bedi and Tamil actor Prabhu Ganesan. Reportedly the costliest Telugu production of all time, the film released on 1 April 2011.[3][4][5][6] A dubbed Tamil version was simultaneously released in Tamil Nadu.[7] Both the versions received negative response from the critics as well as in the commercial status.\n\n\nPlot:\n\nAishwarya (Ileana D'Cruz)is the daughter of central union police Mahadeva Raya (Prabhu Ganesan. Due to some reason, he doesn't allow his daughter to go on a trip with friends. Not knowing the reason,she elopes from home with her friends to the trip.She then meets a guide, Shakti (Jr. NTR), who takes her and her friends on a trip to several places. At first, she hates him because he uses every chance to get money from her. But when he saves her when she falls off in snow, she starts liking him. Afterwards, a few people who are chasing her finally find her in Kashmir and try to kill shakti as he hurt them before. But their plan fails as Shakti turns out to be a NSS Secret Agent and defends himself and catches the main person in this plan. When Aishwarya goes back to her father, he forgives her and asks whether she had taken a box in which there is a diamond. When she says that she has not taken, he says that it is more important than his own daughter. Later, when Shakti goes to a temple , the diamond box suddenly falls off from a basket his mother brought with flowers on top of it. They then inform Mahadevaraya who asks them to immediately come to Humpy with the box and Aishwarya. Their travel is blocked by a strong man who is then defeated by Shakti. He then kills one more person who tries to grab the box. Then Mahadevaraya and a Holy Swami (Nassar) come to him and then the flashback is revealed.\nIt is said that Mahadevaraya'a father (S. P. Balasubramaniam) was a royal king who was extremely generous and had the blessings of god which gave him the power that whenever he touched the diamond, it used to shine brightly emitting light. He tells that apart from the 18 Shakti petas, there is a secret one which protects India and only their family knows of it. He tells that there is also a protector who guards it all time. His name is Rudra (Jr. NTR). After every 27 years, they must go to the shakti peta where the protector will perform several spiritual rites which must be compulsorily performed. When he starts performing them, an Egypt king who knows of this comes to destroy that shakti peta and destroy whole India. The protector kills the Egypt king but a person who works under the Mahadevaraya's father, Janaki Varma (Jackie Shroff) cheats him and kills both the protector and Mahadevaraya as he sought money from the Egypt king. He also steals a sword (MahaTrishulam) which is necessary for the rites to be performed. When the protector is killed, his wife, at the same time, delivers a baby boy whom Rudra gives to his loyal servant. The servant tries his best to save the boy but circumstances force him to throw the boy into the river. The boy is then found by a childless couple who adopt him.After finding out his past, he sets ut for revenge. Shakti then goes to Janaki's country where he is presently the underworld don and a multimillionaire. He kills Janaki and gets the sword. Finally he goes to perform the rites but is stopped by Egypt queen and her powerful son who comes back and cannot be defeated. The swami then tells him that the strong man can only be defeated by damaging his eyes. He then kills him and performs the ritess.\n\nCAST:\n\nNTR Jr. as Shakti Swaroop/Rudra\nIleana D'Cruz as Aishwarya Mahadevaraya\nManjari Phadnis as Rudra's Wife\nS. P.
