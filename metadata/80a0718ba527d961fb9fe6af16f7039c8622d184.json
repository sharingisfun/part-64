Today, science forecasts that the oceans are getting fiercer, rising up to reshape our coastlines and create untold devastation, social unrest and economic crisis. Track the history and evolution of the ocean's seven deadliest zones--locations that throughout history have been the direct causes of human devastation by floods, tsunamis, hurricanes, whirlpools, ice, underwater volcanoes, and shipping graveyards. Using expedition footage, 3D animation, and commentary from leading oceanographers, we'll depict the awesome cosmic and geological fluctuations that make the oceans deadly over time.\n\nTechnical Specs \nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1534 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 416\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9) \nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 90.Mins\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.09 GB (1,121 MB)\nEncoded by: Harry65 \nSource: DVD\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80a0718ba527d961fb9fe6af16f7039c8622d184","amp;dn":"Underwater+Universe+Special","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80a0718ba527d961fb9fe6af16f7039c8622d184","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,160,113,139,165,39,217,97,251,159,230,175,22,247,3,156,134,34,209,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
