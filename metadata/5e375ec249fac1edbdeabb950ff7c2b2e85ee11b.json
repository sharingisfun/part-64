It then organizes those snaps into a library where you can tag, rate and comment them.\n\nIt also comes with some built-in vector tools that allow you to mark up your images with text, callouts, shapes, lines, arrows, blurs and highlighting. Best of all, the annotations are all non-destructive allowing you to hide and show them at a moment's notice. \n\nThen share the snaps with your clients colleagues and friends. To make that possible, we've built in support for Flickr, image exports, FTP, SFTP and our own web-service especially for LittleSnapper users: QuickSnapper.\n\nWhat's New\n\n* Mac OS X Lion Compatibility\n\n* Fixed up an issue that caused the LittleSnapper Snap File QuickLook\n  importer to break QuickLook support for other file types.\n\n* Other small tweaks and enhancements.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac OS 10.6.6 or better\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e375ec249fac1edbdeabb950ff7c2b2e85ee11b","amp;dn":"LittleSnapper+v.+1.8.0+%2B+Core+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e375ec249fac1edbdeabb950ff7c2b2e85ee11b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,55,94,194,73,250,193,237,189,234,187,149,15,247,194,178,232,94,225,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
