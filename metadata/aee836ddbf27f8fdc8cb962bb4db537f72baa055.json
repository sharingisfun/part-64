Soon enough they will lead Egypt, to where no one knows but many has expectations.\n\nThe series of El Gama3a was made by the Egyptian Mass Media about a year ago to demonstrate the history of the Brotherhood, their origin, intent, and how they have mixed religion with politics to reach their objectives.\n\nThe series is supposedly based on authentic historic documents. And in my personal opinion it is more than enough for anyone who wants to know their history without having to read through books.\n\nUp till now there are no english subtitles, and the spoken language is in Arabic. But hopefully it's on the way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aee836ddbf27f8fdc8cb962bb4db537f72baa055","amp;dn":"Muslim+Brotherhood+Series+in+Arabic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aee836ddbf27f8fdc8cb962bb4db537f72baa055","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,232,54,221,191,39,248,253,200,203,150,43,180,219,83,127,114,186,160,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
