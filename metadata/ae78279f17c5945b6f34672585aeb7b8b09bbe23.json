I'm Worried\n\n\nBarry Big B Brenner's latest CD; &quot;OLD SCHOOL BLUES&quot; is Americana Roots Music at its finest. Recorded in May of 2009, it represents what you would likely hear today at one of Big B's impressive liveshows.\n\nThere are several songs played on low strung acoustic 12-String Guitar (&quot;You Don't Know My Mind&quot;, &quot;Bye Bye Baby Blues&quot; and the rousing &quot;Step It Up and Go!&quot;) as well as some strutting National Resonator Bottleneck Slide Guitar numbers (&quot;Denver Blues&quot; and &quot;I'm Worried&quot;). Be sure to also check out the bawdy story line on the swampy &quot;Silver Street Blues&quot;, an original and quite novel Blues tune about the infamous denizens of the Under-The-Hill crowd down in Natchez, Mississippi. The self-penned instrumentals &quot;Cat Pause&quot; and &quot;Grand Canyon Mules&quot; are just two of the delightful ear candy tracks to be savoured.\n\nAll in all, Big B Brenner's latest digital platter is an enjoyable, eclectic mix of foot tapping, dance floor blues. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae78279f17c5945b6f34672585aeb7b8b09bbe23","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Big+B+Brenner+-+Old+School+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae78279f17c5945b6f34672585aeb7b8b09bbe23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,120,39,159,23,197,148,91,111,52,103,37,133,174,183,184,176,155,190,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
