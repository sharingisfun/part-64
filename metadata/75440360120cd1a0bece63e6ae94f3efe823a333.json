Thanks\n\nKick ass rock group that toured the southeast extensively during the early 90's. Members have gone on to be in such bands as Sevendust, Stuck Mojo, Life of Agony, DoubleDrive, Dark New Day. Some of these files are poor sound quality as they were converted from analog (cassettes) But some are from CD's. I included them all because I know any fans would love to have them all even if they are subpar. Added some videos.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75440360120cd1a0bece63e6ae94f3efe823a333","amp;dn":"Still+Rain+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75440360120cd1a0bece63e6ae94f3efe823a333","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,68,3,96,18,12,209,160,190,206,99,230,174,148,243,239,232,35,163,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
