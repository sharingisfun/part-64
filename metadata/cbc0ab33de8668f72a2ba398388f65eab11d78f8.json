The story revolves around a legendary Warrior Priest from the last Vampire War who now lives in obscurity among the other downtrodden human inhabitants in walled-in dystopian cities ruled by the Church. When his niece is abducted by a murderous pack of vampires, Priest breaks his sacred vows to venture out on a quest to find her before they turn her into one of them. He is joined on his crusade by his niece\\'s boyfriend, a trigger-fingered young wasteland sheriff, and a former Warrior Priestess who possesses otherworldly fighting skills.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbc0ab33de8668f72a2ba398388f65eab11d78f8","amp;dn":"Priest.2011-Blu+ray-720p-1chin2three","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbc0ab33de8668f72a2ba398388f65eab11d78f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,192,171,51,222,134,104,247,42,43,163,152,56,143,101,234,177,29,120,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
