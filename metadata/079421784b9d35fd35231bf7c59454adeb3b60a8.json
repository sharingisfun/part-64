Mainieri was one of fusion's early progenitors: Journey Through an Electric Tube (Solid State, 1968) and White Elephant (Solid State, 1969) explored new ways to incorporate a rock aesthetic with jazz. But while Burton has settled into a more mainstream comfort zone in recent years, Mainieri continues to test new waters. Northern Lights teams him with the &quot;Norwegian Posse&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a veritable who's who of the contemporary Norwegian scene. The result blends the groove and ambience of nu jazz with a somewhat more emphatic approach to soloing.\n\nNorthern Lights features four-fifths of trumpeter Nils Petter Molvaer's groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including Molvaer, guitar soundscapist Eyvind Aarset, live sampler/beat programmer Jan Bang and turntablist DJ StrangefruitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½so it's no surprise that the disc leans heavily toward atmosphere and a generally more selfless approach emphasizing the collective rather than any individual. Drummer Anders Engen (a regular collaborator with the also-present keyboardist Bugge Wesseltoft) and Swedish bassist Lars Danielsson form a rhythm section that's more straightforward than typically found in nu jazz. Still, while the program includes a trio of standards alongside Mainieri's compositions and a Bjork song, the treatments are anything but conventional.\n\n&quot;Nature Boy,&quot; which opens the disc with a gentle reggae groove, is a strong feature for both Molvaer and Mainieri's lyrical, less-is-more approach. Miles Davis' &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot; is propelled by a gentle backbeat, while John Coltrane's &quot;Naima&quot; is given an Afro-centric reading, thanks to Paolo Vinacchia's hand drums and Mainieri's marimba. The vibe is cool, but not the Nordic cool that's more a stereotypical misconception these days. Relaxed in approach, Mainieri is surrounded by a group of musicians whose command of electronics and processing is so well-integrated that it feels completely organic and, in the case of those playing &quot;conventional&quot; instruments, a thoroughly natural extension.\n\nMainieri's writing ranges from the techno-centric &quot;Poochie Pie&quot; to the Latin-esque &quot;Vertigo&quot; and the snaky groove of &quot;Dance of Ran.&quot; &quot;Bang&quot; is dancefloor-ready; saxophonist Bendik Hofseth's solo sound like a funky and energetic extension of Jan Garbarek's earlier years. One could imagine Mainieri playing the balladic &quot;Remembrance&quot; with his Steps Ahead group, but here the added string quartet and atmospherics provided by Bang, Strangefruit and Aarset take it to a more ethereal place.\n\nWhile the cross-pollination of artists from around the world is becoming more common, too few recorded documents exist. The ever-adaptable Mainieri fits perfectly within the sphere of nu jazz's equally malleable improvisational take on electronica. Hopefully Northern Lights will bring well-deserved North American attention to the &quot;Norwegian Posse&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and, by extension, the entire vibrant and forward-thinking Scandinavian scene.\n\nTrack Listing: Nature Boy; Poochie Pie; I've Seen It All; Vertigo; Flamenco Sketches; Naima; Dance of Ran; Bang; Remembrance.\n\nPersonnel: Mike Mainieri: vibraphone, marimba; Nils Petter Molvaer: trumpet; Bendik Hofseth: saxophones; Bugge Wesseltoft: keyboards, synths, acoustic and prepared piano; Eyvind Aarset: electric guitar; Lars Danielsson: bass; Anders Engen: drums; Paolo Vinaccia: percussion; Jan Bang: live sampling, beat programming; DJ Strangefruit: turntables.\n\nRecord Label: NYC Records | Style: Electronica\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:079421784b9d35fd35231bf7c59454adeb3b60a8","amp;dn":"Mike+Mainieri+-+Northern+Lights","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"079421784b9d35fd35231bf7c59454adeb3b60a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,148,33,120,75,157,53,253,53,35,27,247,197,148,84,173,235,59,96,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
