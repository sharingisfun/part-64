IMO, it's just this side of acceptable quality for a watch-it-once-then-toss-it program.\n\nGuests include:\no  Brian Beutler: reporter for Talking Points Memo\no  Markos Moulitsas: founder and publisher of Daily Kos\no  Ken Vogel: reporter for Politico\no  Karl Frisch: syndicated columnist, Democratic strategist\no  Christian Finnegan: stand-up comedian, actor\n\n&quot;Please watch Keith on Current if you can get the channel, harass your cable company if you cannot. Keep celebrating freedom of news.&quot;\n~olberfann @ demonoid\n\nReduced in size by handbrake.\n\nContainer: MP4\nVideo codec: H.264\nResolution 512 x 384\nAudio: AAC 44.1KHz Stereo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dbf4b2b29e37a8a88a03b81a9997106d6089c16","amp;dn":"Countdown+with+Keith+Olbermann%3A+2011-09-07+H.264+AAC+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dbf4b2b29e37a8a88a03b81a9997106d6089c16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,191,75,43,41,227,122,138,136,160,59,129,169,153,113,6,214,8,156,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
