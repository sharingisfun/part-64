John Farley (Seann William Scott) grew up as a chubby kid with no athletic skills and poor self-esteem, and during his early teenage years his nemesis was Mr. Woodcock (Billy Bob Thornton), his junior-high gym teacher, who took a sadistic glee in tormenting John and others like them. Years later, John has slimmed down, come to terms with his self-image, and become a best-selling author, publishing a self-help book on overcoming the specters of the past. John comes home to visit his widowed mother, Beverly (Susan Sarandon), and discovers she has a surprise for him -- she's getting married again, and her new fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e is none other than Mr. Woodcock. Horrified, John is determined to keep Beverly from walking down the aisle with Woodcock, and along the way finds himself struggling to settle some old scores. Mr. Woodcock also stars Amy Poehler as John's publicist and Ethan Suplee as John's old friend Needleman. \n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 28 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\nFrame Width: 800\n\nFrame Height: 336\n\nFrame Rate: 30fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 113kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77eb33c3c1bca1180eb659ce4cac120e46402e8f","amp;dn":"Mr.+Woodcock%282007%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77eb33c3c1bca1180eb659ce4cac120e46402e8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,235,51,195,193,188,161,24,14,182,89,206,76,172,18,14,70,64,46,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
