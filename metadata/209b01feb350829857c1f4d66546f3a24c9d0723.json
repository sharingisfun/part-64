It's man versus computer as the gang races a computer-controlled BMW around Laguna Seca Raceway. Later, Dan Neil ditches his usual cardigan for a helmet and fire suit and to find out what dirt-track racing is all about, and the guys debate who builds the best convertible sports car in the world, the Europeans or the good old US of A? Special Guest: the legendary Pete Brock, designer of the iconic Shelby Daytona Coupe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:209b01feb350829857c1f4d66546f3a24c9d0723","amp;dn":"The+Car+Show+-+s01e03+-+Man+vs+Computer+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"209b01feb350829857c1f4d66546f3a24c9d0723","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,155,1,254,179,80,130,152,87,193,244,214,101,70,243,162,76,157,7,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
