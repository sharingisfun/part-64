The set's a live one, done supposedly with a bit of theatrical flair - and Nyberg's got a presence here that's even bolder than on her earlier records - singing some wonderful original numbers with tight backing by a piano trio whose style, like Nyberg's, goes way beyond traditional jazz! Many of the tunes have a rhythmic quality - not really funky, but kind of pulsating with their own energy in a really cool way - similar to some of the groovier modes that Monica Zetterlund used back in the 70s. A few tunes are instrumental - to showcase the piano talents of Cecilia Persson, the leader of the trio - and titles include One Little Step, Yokohama, Say It Isn't So, I'm A Fish, Open Rein, and Sailor Song - plus a great version of the Peggy Lee tune Where Did They Go.
