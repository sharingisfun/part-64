For that reason, she creates worlds in her mind, her attempts to free herself from the reality engulfing her. Her imaginary lives are dives into her own self and in the unknown of the unconscious the stories and worlds she creates are many times worse than her real life. Even though it is through those daydreams she will know her real self, she is not comfortable with what they show her. In one of them, she will face Mr. Wells, a sadistic white southern man whom she will fall in love with. She will also meet Jack, a poor, white worker who is a lighter version of Mr. Wells and will finally take Marcylene where she wants to be, a place where reality and daydreaming are dangerously confusing.
