You get the smartest people together in a room and they lay out a plan that everyone will follow. Reminds me of Obamacare. Wise leaders will provide a central plan for all of us. That is the route to equality and prosperity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c171892fbb8b32bde1515cb1c481fc3ed8229f4d","amp;dn":"20110707-Stossel-%5BOn+the+Road+to+Serfdom%5D-Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c171892fbb8b32bde1515cb1c481fc3ed8229f4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,113,137,47,187,139,50,189,225,81,92,177,196,129,252,62,216,34,159,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
