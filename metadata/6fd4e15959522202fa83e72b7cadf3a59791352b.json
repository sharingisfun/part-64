It is nearly impossible to find torrent files that include all the extras or even important commentaries.\nThese files are from my collection of DVDs that I have made from rented movies over the last seven years or so.\nNearly all of them have been put onto a DVD5, so unfortunately I do not have an uncompressed source handy.  That said I can assure you that these look GREAT on larger screens.\nI chose to make them this size for economy as DVD9s were $3 each when I started this and DVD5s were .25 cents each.\nNow I am working on putting some of the best ones on a hard drive to be played with my HD TV media Player and am still thinking economy is the best rule as these are half the size of ripping a DVD9.\nThis is the best quality for the value.\n\nI would love some productive feedback  . . .   :)\n\nThis is a DVD rip to an ISO; you can watch it on your media player, mount it to a virtual drive or burn it to a DVD.\n\nThis file includes EVERYTHING the original DVD has:\n\n1939\n106 minutes\nBlack and White\n1.33:1\nSpoken Language: French\nSubtitles: English\nIntroduction to the film by director Jean Renoir\nAudio commentary written by film scholar Alexander Sesonske and read by filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich\nComparison of the films two endings\nSelected-scene analysis by Renoir historian Chris Faulkner\n\nSYNOPSIS:  Considered one of the greatest films ever made, The Rules of the Game (La regle du jeu), by Jean Renoir, is a scathing critique of corrupt French society cloaked in a comedy of manners in which a weekend at a marquis country chÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢teau lays bare some ugly truths about a group of haut bourgeois acquaintances. The film has had a tumultuous history: it was subjected to cuts after the violent response of the premiere audience in 1939, and the original negative was destroyed during World War II; it wasnt reconstructed until 1959. That version, which has stunned viewers for decades, is presented here.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fd4e15959522202fa83e72b7cadf3a59791352b","amp;dn":"Rules+Of+The+Game+%281939%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fd4e15959522202fa83e72b7cadf3a59791352b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,212,225,89,89,82,34,2,250,131,231,43,124,173,243,165,151,145,53,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
