But when an unstoppable chain of events unfolds, everyone soon realizes no one is who they seem and the job may be something other than eliminating the competition. What started as simple instructions has now turned into a deadly cat-and-mouse game ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with large guns pointed at everyone.\n\nNOTES : RippeR brings to you another high quality release in small size. English Subtitles added.
