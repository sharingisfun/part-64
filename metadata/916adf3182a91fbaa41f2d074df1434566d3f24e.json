Kaufman has planned the ultimate marathon of lost film prints to unleash upon his faithful cinephile patrons. Four films so rare that they have never been exhibited publicly on American soil until this very night! With titles like Wadzilla, I Was A Teenage Werebear, The Diary of Anne Frankenstein, and Zom-B-Movie, Chillerama not only celebrates the golden age of drive-in B horror shlock but also spans over four decades of cinema with something for every bad taste.\nDirector: Adam Green, Joe Lynch,Adam Rifkin,Tim Sullivan\nStars:          Richard Riehle, Adam Rifkin and Ray Wise\nimdb:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1727252/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1727252/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/7liX3.png[/IMG]\n\nscreenshots\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/818/vlcsnap2011120223h27m27.png/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/818/vlcsnap2011120223h27m27.png/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/215/vlcsnap2011120223h27m48.png/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/215/vlcsnap2011120223h27m48.png/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/607/vlcsnap2011120223h28m30.png/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/607/vlcsnap2011120223h28m30.png/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/835/vlcsnap2011120223h28m45.png/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/835/vlcsnap2011120223h28m45.png/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/wF4BC.png[/IMG]\n\n         VISIT MY BLOG   or           for fb page links\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/FkbPX.gif[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:916adf3182a91fbaa41f2d074df1434566d3f24e","amp;dn":"Chillerama+%282011%29+BRrip_720p+_sujaidr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"916adf3182a91fbaa41f2d074df1434566d3f24e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,106,223,49,130,169,31,186,164,31,45,7,77,241,67,69,102,211,242,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
