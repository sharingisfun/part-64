During the late 40's and the early 50's, there seem to be hundreds of these clubs. This film shows a fascinating look at a North Country mill town, with a refreshing absence of traffic jams, yellow lines , traffic wardens, and other things we have become accustomed to seeing on our roads today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:460e96ace00d0a4faefd5ac5ed98d4b3199abbd1","amp;dn":"A+Boy%2C+A+Girl+and+a+Bike+%281949%29+%5BDVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"460e96ace00d0a4faefd5ac5ed98d4b3199abbd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,14,150,172,224,13,10,79,174,253,90,197,237,152,212,179,25,154,187,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
