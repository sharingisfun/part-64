One day, Mashiro draws a picture of Miho Azuki, a girl he is secretly fond of, during class but forgets the notebook at school. He comes back to find that his classmate Akito Takagi is waiting for him with his notebook. Takagi tries to convince Mashiro to become a mangaka, a manga artist, with him, leading to Mashiro\\'s disagreement. Mashiro goes home and thinks about his mangaka uncle, who had only one successful series before he died in obscurity. Mashiro is interrupted by a phone call from Takagi, who says that he is going to tell Azuki that Mashiro likes her. Mashiro runs down to Azuki\\'s house to find Takagi waiting for him. Once Azuki comes out to meet them, Takagi tells her that he and Mashiro are aiming to be mangaka. Mashiro then learns that she wants to be a seiyuu, a voice actor, and has shown promise in the field. Mashiro, once again thinking about his uncle, accidentally proposes to Azuki who accepts. However, she will only marry him after they achieve their dreams. In addition, they cannot see each other until then\n\n\n\nAudio language         : Japanese\n\nSubTitle language      : English\n\nRelease date           : February 13, 2012\n\nGenres                 : comedy, drama\n\nThemes                 : manga, MangakÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\nCompleteName                     : E:\\\\animes upload\\\\ungogogog\\\\[SFW-sage]_Bakuman_S2_-_19_[720p][247F3D14].mkv.bc!\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFormat_Version                   : Version 2\nFileSize/String                  : 256 MiB\nDuration/String                  : 24mn 29s\nOverallBitRate/String            : 1 464 Kbps\n\n\nVideo\n\n\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat_Profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7038191718303c445e41&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat_Settings_CABAC/String     : Yes\nFormat_Settings_RefFrames/String : 9 frames\nCodecID                          : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration/String                  : 24mn 29s\nWidth/String                     : 1 280 pixels\nHeight/String                    : 720 pixels\nDisplayAspectRatio/String        : 16:9\nFrameRate/String                 : 23.976 fps\nColorSpace                       : YUV\nChromaSubsampling                : 4:2:0\nBitDepth/String                  : 8 bits\n\n\nAudio\n\n\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat_Profile                   : LC\nCodecID                          : A_AAC\nDuration/String                  : 24mn 29s\nChannel(s)/String                : 2 channels\nChannelPositions                 : Front: L R\nSamplingRate/String              : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String          : Lossy\nLanguage/String                  : Japanese\nDefault/String                   : Yes\nForced/String                    : No\n\n\n\nIf you have problems with playback, update your video codecs or codec packs.\n(CCCP/FFDshow Tryouts/CoreAVC/whatever else people use).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b990d4968917a9ef7268b1bee5f0ff750beabf7b","amp;dn":"Bakuman+S2+19+%5BSFW-sage%5D%5B720p%5D%5B247F3D14%5Dmkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b990d4968917a9ef7268b1bee5f0ff750beabf7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,144,212,150,137,23,169,239,114,104,177,190,229,240,255,117,11,234,191,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
