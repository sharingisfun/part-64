In Ottawa on a clandestine\nloversÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ weekend, we spent most of the time in our hotel room greedily\nexploring each other. Late Saturday night, we lay side by side breathing\ndeeply, our sweat soaked bodies flung wide, gathering ourselves for\nanother round of lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most joyous dance. I stretched my leg so that my\ntoes rested on AlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s instep. As my skin touched his, electric pulses raced\nthrough me, from my toes through my legs and groin, all the way up to\nmy head and back down. On the outside, I was barely moving. My body\nwas a lacy ribbon waving lazily on a light summer breeze. Inside, it was as\nif the entire lava load of an erupting volcano were surging through my\nveins at incredible velocity. Every fiber of my being was shot through with\nlight, like a time-lapse photo of car headlamps beaming down a dark\nroadway. I closed my eyes and let the blaze run. The familiar blackness\nbehind my eyelids became a deep blue, vast, open, and welcoming. Huge\npurple orbs floated by, amethyst geodes trailing light. I lay in ecstatic\nwonder marveling at the beauty and the glory.\nWhen I moved my foot away from AlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, breaking the spell of our\nconnection, the flowing stopped. When I touched him again, it recommenced.\nExperimenting, I touched our bodies together at different\nspotsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½finger to nipple, hip to thigh, forehead to forehead. Each joining\nmade a bridge for the transporting energy stream. My heart opened.\nLove poured in with the fire. The laughter of bliss rose up from its flames.\nUnable to speak, I could only keen trilling ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œohsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ into the night. Like a\nkiss from God, the merging came, a melting into Al, the room, the city.\nI was All, and All was rapture. When daylight found us, I was still flying\nhigh on loveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ardent wings.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhat was that? Where did it come from? Do you think we can do\nit again?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œProbably. I think what we experienced was something I have heard\nabout called Tantra,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ replied Al, my new lover, my seeker of enlightenment,\nand explorer of all things spiritual.\nWe set off for the nearest bookstore to find out more about this\nmysterious Tantra. It was the beginning of a journey that has wrought\nextraordinary change in our lives, brought us ecstatic pleasure and intimate\nconnection, and freed our hearts and awakened our spirits. It is a\njourney that continues...........\n\n\ndownload to read\n\nseed! seed! seed!\t\n\nkick ass torrent http://www.kat.ph/user/j-william/\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc341811c292546b6d5f5d36c64bd938220e43d5","amp;dn":"Soul+Sex+Excerpts.pdf.%5BJ-William%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc341811c292546b6d5f5d36c64bd938220e43d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,52,24,17,194,146,84,107,109,95,93,54,198,75,217,56,34,14,67,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
