The pair       \n    lie in wait for factory owner George B. Lambert while he is playing      \n    golf with his spoiled dbutant daughter, Betty, and send up their        \n    radio-controlled model where Lambert cannot fail to notice it. But       \n    Jerry sets the model down in a pool of water and douses Betty.           \n    Lambert authorizes Jerry and Doc to test their remote-controlled         \n    robot pilot on one of his planes for the Army. Jerry flies the plane     \n    up, bails out and Doc is to land the plane using his remote control      \n    box. But foreign agents, wishing to hamper the development of the        \n    robot pilot, have tampered with the controls, and Doc is unable to       \n    pull the plane out of a spin, and it crashes. Lambert fires Jerry and    \n    he and Doc return to the remote weather outpost to do more work on       \n    their invention. Betty, on her way to Hollywood to be a movie star,      \n    is driving across the desert with her Aunt Maude and runs out of         \n    gas,and Betty borrows some gas belonging to the U.S. government, and     \n    is caught by Jerry. He decides to place her under arrest, pending the    \n    arrival, in a week's time, of the U.S. Marshal. Jerry makes Betty and    \n    Aunt Maude do housework and chores. The spies steal a plane, crash in    \n    the desert, show up and make some trouble, and try to get away in a      \n    car in which Betty and Aunt Maude are hiding in the trunk.               \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
