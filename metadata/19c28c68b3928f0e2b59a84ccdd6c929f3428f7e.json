You can even shut it down and restart it without\n  starting civilization again.\n\n* You do not have to do a next turn anymore to have the gold\n  cheat work.\n\n\n=============\nAbout Trainer\n=============\n\nThis trainer is designed to work with Civilization 5 v 1.0.1.348\nDirectX 9 and DirectX 11.\n\nDo not attempt to use it with earlier or future versions of the game.\nIt will contaminate and corrupt memory if you do.\n\nThis trainer will give you the following:\n\n * Gold\n * Golden Age Progress\n * Golden Age Turns\n * Culture\n * Strategic Resources\n * Luxury Resources\n * Clear spent resource slots\n * Great General\n * Unit Experience\n * Movement\n * Heal units\n * City Modifier\n * Full hotkey support\n * May set custom values\n\n============\nInstallation\n============\n\n1. Create a new folder anywhere you like.\n2. Extract this archive into that folder.\n3. Done.\n\n==========\nHow to use\n==========\n\n1. Start trainer first.\n2. Start game secondly.\n\n===============\nSwitched Cheats\n===============\n\n1: MOVEMENT SWITCH:\nThis cheat will give unlimited movement points to units. Activate it and then click any unit, in any number, in any priority and move them around. Always remember to deactivate a switched cheat before making another turn.\n\nSet the initial movement point in the left editbox to set a default initial value for your units. Why would you want to set a initial movement score when the movement is already infinite?\n\nThe reason is simple: Because if you have 1 movement point left, it will cancel if you try to move it more than 1 hex, its pretty annoying. The default initial value is already set so you do not need to worry about it.\n\n2: EXPERIENCE SWITCH:\nThis cheat will give experience to your units. Set a initial experience value in the editbox on the left, then click all your units. You only need to click them once. Then deactivate the cheat when finished.\n\n3: HEALING SWITCH:\nThis cheat will set health points on your units. Set the health point you want in the editbox on the left side (it can be in the range of 0-10 where 0 is no health and 10 is full health) Then click all units you want to set this health value upon. Deactivate the cheat when finished.\n\n4: CITY MODIFIER SWITCH:\nThis is probably the most complex cheat to use. (It\\\\\\'s really not that complex). This cheat will set the city modifier value (it is in percentage %).\n\nIt will set the modifier value on 3 things: Production, Science and Gold. To have this cheat work you will need to buy OR sell a building that affects any of these 3 areas. Thats it.\n\nQuick hint: I recommend buying:\nUniversity (to enable modifier for science)\nFactory (to enable production modifier)\nStock Exchange (to enable gold modifier)\n\nYou can also sell buildings that affects these areas, the modifier will update that way too.\n\n=============\nHotkeys note:\n=============\n\nALT + F1 = Anti Movement-Cost Cheat\nALT + F2 = Train Unit Experience\nALT + F3 = Set Health on units\n\nALT + F5 = Set City Modifier (Science,Production and Gold)\n\nALT + BACKSPACE = Turn off all cheat switches\n\nALT + INSERT = Resources (Maximum)\nALT + HOME = Gold (Maximum)\nALT + PAGEUP = Culture (Maximum)\n\nALT + DELETE = Golden Age Progress (Maximum)\nALT + END = Golden Age Turns (Maximum)\nALT + PAGEDOWN = Great General Progress (Maximum)\n\nALT + LEFT = Free all used resource slots\nALT + RIGHT = Zero all (Will zero out the following):\n  1: Gold\n  2: Golden Age Progress\n  3: Golden Age Turns\n  4: Culture\n  5: All Strategic and Luxury Resources\n  6: Great General Progress\n\n===============\nUpDown Controls\n===============\n\nI have added Up-Down controls to all edit boxes in the program.\nYou may change values in an edit box in many ways:\n\n1: Click a button to choose a predefined value.\n2: Click the edit box and type a custom value.\n3: Click the up-down control buttons to change values.\n4: Use the up-down arrow keys on your keyboard.\n5: Use mouse wheel to change values.\n\n===============\nTroubleshooting\n===============\n\nQ1: Trainer doesnt work?\nA1: Use only with Civ 5 version 1.0.1.348. It will not work with other versions.\n\nQ2: Trainer still doesnt work?\nA2: Your firewall/antivirus blocked it, unblock it and run it again. I need to do this myself all the time.\n\nQ3: Trainer is still not working?\nA3: The 6 primary cheats will only update after you click a city or do a next turn.\n\nQ4: I use WinXP and the trainer runs and quits almost instantly?\nA4: Try to run it using Win98 Compatability mode.\n\n======\nAuthor\n======\n\nCoded by DelphiUniverse in pure assembly language.\n\nMy favorite coding equipment:\n\n* SteelSeries 7G keyboard (Nothing close to it, nothing above it)\n* 26\\\\\\&quot; 2ms screen for coding happiness","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19c28c68b3928f0e2b59a84ccdd6c929f3428f7e","amp;dn":"Civilization+V+Trainer+v+4.0.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19c28c68b3928f0e2b59a84ccdd6c929f3428f7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,194,140,104,179,146,143,14,43,89,168,76,205,214,201,41,243,66,143,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
