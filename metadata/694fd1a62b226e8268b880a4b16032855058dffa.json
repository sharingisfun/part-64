This is a completely legit vid but I am uploading it as anonymous for the simple reason that I wouldn't want EA to find out and ban me from playing Battlefield 3 when it comes out as I'm so psyched for the game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:694fd1a62b226e8268b880a4b16032855058dffa","amp;dn":"Battlefield+3+%28Leaked+footage+from+GamesCom+2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"694fd1a62b226e8268b880a4b16032855058dffa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,79,209,166,43,34,110,130,104,184,128,164,177,96,50,133,80,88,223,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
