The entire city's population has vanished into thin air, leaving behind heaps of empty clothing, abandoned cars and lengthening shadows. Soon the daylight begins to disappear completely, and as the survivors gather in an abandoned tavern, they realize the darkness is out to get them, and only their rapidly diminishing light sources can keep them safe\n\n\nThe population of Detroit has almost completely disappeared, but a few remain. As daylight disappears they realize that the Dark is coming for them.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1452628/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1452628/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3b3f21e1747cf0bf92631eeba4a1af9edebb19d","amp;dn":"Vanishing+on+7th+Street+%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3b3f21e1747cf0bf92631eeba4a1af9edebb19d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,179,242,30,23,71,207,11,249,38,49,238,186,74,26,249,237,235,177,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
