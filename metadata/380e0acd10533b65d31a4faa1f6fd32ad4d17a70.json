Now called Necropolis, it is a city that eats sin. The vampires of Necropolis wait patiently for the Empire's weekly drop off of guilty Penitents; sinners and criminals full of fresh blood.\n\nHank Evans is one of those Penitents and he would gladly let the vampires take every drop of his blood if it werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t for one detail: Toby. Toby is HankÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s only son. Now, Hank must do whatever it takes to escape the city of the dead and save his son from an Empire as bloodthirsty as the vampires it uses to keep its people in line.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:380e0acd10533b65d31a4faa1f6fd32ad4d17a70","amp;dn":"Shining+in+Crimson+Episode+02+by+Robert+S.+Wilson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"380e0acd10533b65d31a4faa1f6fd32ad4d17a70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,14,10,205,16,83,59,101,211,26,79,170,31,111,211,42,212,209,122,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
