The songs themselves are catchy, but not at all in a dance sense. These are just beautifully crafted melodies over very well-written, well-played songs. She has an interesting voice, one that is very distinctive - I believe that I could tell if it was her singing any song.\n\nThis is a musician who deserves a large, large audience in North America and around the world. Though she is Swedish, all her songs are in English, and there is nothing trite about the lyrics.\n\nThere are a couple of stand-out compositions on this solid CD that has no filler songs. I am particularly taken with the title track, which always strikes me as moody and somewhat melancholic - wistful, like a woman waiting forever for her lover to return.\n(review, amazon.com)\n\n- - -\n\nRebecka TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rnqvist - Tremble my Heart 1998\n(Solna EMI)\n\n 1.
