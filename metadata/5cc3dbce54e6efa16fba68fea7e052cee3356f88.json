Using state-of-the-art special effects and historic footage, the program shows how today's science fiction can become tomorrow's science fact.\n\nOriginally aired in 1987...recovered from an old VHS tape TV recording and saved for posterity to compare those predictions to what actually happened or will happen in the future. For example, they predicted back in 1987 that there would be an international space station. 10 predictions in all explained thoroughly.\n\nMPG format ready for burning to DVD if you want to. That is why it is so big of a file size. If there is enough interest, I will provide a smaller resolution video copy.  720x480 resolution 4:3 format.\n\nStars Christopher Reeve along with Neil Armstrong, John Glenn, Ted Kennedy, and Jeana Yeager.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cc3dbce54e6efa16fba68fea7e052cee3356f88","amp;dn":"Future+Flight+%28TV-1987%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cc3dbce54e6efa16fba68fea7e052cee3356f88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,195,219,206,84,230,239,161,111,186,104,254,167,224,82,206,227,53,111,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
