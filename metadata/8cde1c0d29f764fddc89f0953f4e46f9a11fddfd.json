It is inspired by a review of common changes made by IT departments deploying Ubuntu at scale.\n\nThe remix retains all the goodness of Ubuntu and is compatible with all Ubuntu certified hardware, apps and tools, adding business-focused tools from the standard Ubuntu and partner archives and removing home-user oriented apps. There are no modified or enhanced packages in the remix, and the remix gets its security updates from the same place as standard Ubuntu; itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just a convenient starting point that includes many common changes made by IT administrators deploying Ubuntu in a corporate setting.\n\nThis first release includes the Adobe Flash Plugin, VMware View, and the OpenJDK 6 Java run-time environment, while removing social networking and file sharing applications, games and development/sysadmin tools.\n\nThe result is a simple base image that can be deployed into your corporate environment or used as a starting point for further customisation. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Ubuntu, Jim, exactly as you know it.\n\n32-bit x86 installation images are available now for free download with registration below. Deployments can be supported through a standard Ubuntu Advantage agreement from Canonical, or unpaid. Management of large scale deployments of this remix or standard Ubuntu Desktop deployments is best achieved with CanonicalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Landscape management tool. Archives, packages and updates are identical to all other Ubuntu images.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cde1c0d29f764fddc89f0953f4e46f9a11fddfd","amp;dn":"Ubuntu+Business+Desktop+Remix+11.10+x86","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cde1c0d29f764fddc89f0953f4e46f9a11fddfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,222,28,13,41,247,100,253,220,137,240,149,63,78,70,249,161,31,221,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
