While The Economist refers to itself as a newspaper, each print edition appears on glossy paper, like a news magazine. In 2009, it reported an average circulation of just over 1.6 million copies per issue,[3] above half of which are sold in North America and English speaking countries.[4]\nThe Economist claims it &quot;is not a chronicle of economics.&quot;[5] Rather, it aims &quot;to take part in a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.&quot;[6] It takes an editorial stance which is supportive of free trade, globalisation, government health and education spending[citation needed], as well as other, more limited forms of governmental intervention. It targets highly educated readers and claims an audience containing many influential executives and policy-makers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50a51a2d3aac35adf3c83f3dd672687915b33496","amp;dn":"The+Economist+July+30th+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50a51a2d3aac35adf3c83f3dd672687915b33496","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,165,26,45,58,172,53,173,243,200,63,61,214,114,104,121,21,179,52,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
