Ready and prepared to place his body between his employer and a bullet, the bodyguard must be able to blend into the milieu around his charge, yet be ready to spring into action instantly to counter an attack. Based on techniques of the U.S. Secret Service, U.S. State Department Security, the Special Air Service, the Royal Corps of Military Police, the Metropolitan Police, the KGB and its successor the FSB, France's GSPR, and other protective units around the world, The Bodyguard Manual details the steps a protective team takes to prevent attack as well as the tactics which are employed when it is necessary to counter an attack in progress. From security aboard Concorde, the Orient Express, or the Queen Elizabeth 2, to protecting a military general officer in combat, The Bodyguard Manual allows the reader to &quot;stand post&quot; with the professional bodyguard.\nAbout the Author\nLeroy Thompson is a respected author and expert on special operations and the world's elite forces.
