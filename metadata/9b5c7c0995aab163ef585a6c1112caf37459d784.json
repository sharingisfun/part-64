It can also automatically terminate undesired processes, apply default priorities and CPU affinities to processes, limit the number of instances a process can have, and log all processes. It is not a task manager replacement, but does have task manager like capabilities to compliment its primary functions. Process Lasso runs on all editions of Windows 2000, XP, 2003, 2008, Vista, and Windows 7.\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Install Process Lasso with installer\n2. Copy patcher to install directory\n3.
