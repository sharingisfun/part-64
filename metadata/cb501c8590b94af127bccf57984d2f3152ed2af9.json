Cube Explorer 5.00, wrapped in Wineskin with a base table pre-calculated\n2. Same as 1, but with a 1.8GB cube table pre-generated. This version is much larger, and slower to start up, but far faster for solving individual cubes.\n3. Optimal Solver for Mac, with base table pre-generated. This version is dedicated to finding optimal solutions. There is no GUI for entering cubes, and it won't find quick solutions in less than a few seconds. For either of those features, use one of the solvers mentioned above. For fast optimal solutions, use this.\n\nAdditionally, this includes a .jar file that must accompany any .html that is exported from Cube Explorer, side-by-side in the same directory.\n\nCube Explorer uses two algorithms to solve cubes: the two-phase algorithm, which can solve a large number of cubes very quickly, and the optimal algorithm, which always solves a cube in the most efficient manner possible in terms of number of turns.\n\nWhile Cube Explorer supports inputting cube data via a webcam, Wine does not yet have the level of USB webcam support that is required to use it. If this changes, I will upload a new version of this torrent with webcam support.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb501c8590b94af127bccf57984d2f3152ed2af9","amp;dn":"Rubik%5C%27s+Cube+Solvers+for+Mac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb501c8590b94af127bccf57984d2f3152ed2af9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,80,28,133,144,185,74,241,39,188,207,87,152,77,47,49,82,237,42,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
