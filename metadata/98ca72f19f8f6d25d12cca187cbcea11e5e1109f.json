The XGRA is the future \n    sports equivalent of NASCAR or the FIA (Federation Internationale\n    de l'Automobile) They are the rule makers, organizers and ultimately, \n    the overlords of the racing world. \n    Within the XGRA exists a deep and complex community of highly\n    competitive teams, unforgettable riders and unbelievable sponsors,\n    all clamoring for the right to stand atop the XGRA and claim the \n    title of Champion. Along the way, lifelong trusts will be betrayed,\n    bitter rivalries will be forged and some will meet a fate worse\n    than death in this quest for ultimate racing supremacy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98ca72f19f8f6d25d12cca187cbcea11e5e1109f","amp;dn":"XGRA_USA_PS2-ECHELON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98ca72f19f8f6d25d12cca187cbcea11e5e1109f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,202,114,241,159,143,109,37,209,44,202,24,124,188,234,17,229,225,16,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
