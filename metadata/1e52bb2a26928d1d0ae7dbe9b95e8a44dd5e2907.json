This is a combination of performances at the Summerfest event of Milwaukee on June 29th, 2011 and from Summerfest Charlottetown, Canada from July 2nd, 2011. The video isn't of very high quality and the audio is just okay. Quite a few songs are incomplete but especially Two Out of Three looks and sounds very nice. Paradise is again major fun. This impression of Meat's summer tour of 2011 gets 2 out of 5 stars. \n\nSET LIST:\n01 Bat Out of Hell\n02 Los Angeloser\n03 You Took the Words\n04 Anything for Love\n05 Two Out of Three\n06 Paradise by the Dashboard Light\n07 Band Introduction\n08 Boneyard\n09 Freebird Jam","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e52bb2a26928d1d0ae7dbe9b95e8a44dd5e2907","amp;dn":"Meat+Loaf+Live+at+Summerfest+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e52bb2a26928d1d0ae7dbe9b95e8a44dd5e2907","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,82,187,42,38,146,141,29,10,231,219,233,185,94,138,68,221,94,41,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
