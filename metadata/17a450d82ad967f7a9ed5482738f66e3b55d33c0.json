Standard antivirus programs are good at detecting this Malware, but not always so good at effectively removing it.\n\nTrojan Remover is designed specifically to disable/remove Malware without the user having to manually edit system files or the Registry. The program also removes the additional system modifications some Malware carries out which are ignored by standard antivirus and trojan scanners.\n\nWhat Trojan Remover Does\nTrojan Remover examines all the system files, the Windows Registry and the programs and files loaded at boot time. The majority of malicious programs (once triggered) load this way.\n\nTrojan Remover scans ALL the files loaded at boot time for Adware, Spyware, Remote Access Trojans, Internet Worms and other malware. Trojan Remover also checks to see if Windows loads Services which are hidden by Rootkit techniques and warns you if it finds any.\n\nFor each identified Trojan Horse, Worm, or other malware, Trojan Remover pops up an alert screen which shows the file location and name; it offers to remove the program's reference from the system files and allows you to rename the file to stop its activation.\n\nMost modern Malware programs are memory-resident, which makes their de-activation more difficult. How many times have you been told to start your computer in 'Safe' mode, or even worse, in DOS? Trojan Remover does all this for you. When it finds Malware that is memory-resident, Trojan Remover automatically re-starts (on request) your system and completely DISABLES the Malware before Windows restarts.\n\nTrojan Remover writes a detailed logfile every time it performs a scan. This logfile contains information on which programs load at boot-time, and what (if any) actions Trojan Remover carried out. The logfile can be viewed and printed using Notepad.\n\nThe FastScan component of Trojan Remover is set to automatically scan for Malware every time you start your PC (you can disable this if you wish). You can also run the FastScan manually any time you wish (START | Programs | Trojan Remover | FastScan). This FastScan checks all program-loading points - it is a quick and effective check for actively-loading malicious programs.\n\nYou can scan the whole drive, or any directories on the drive, by selecting Scan a Drive/Directory from the main Trojan Remover menu. You can scan individual files and directories from within Windows Explorer.\n\nTrojan Remover incorporates an integral Updater allowing for quick and easy Database updates. You can use the Windows Task Scheduler to schedule automatic updates.\n\nNote : Trojan Remover will not work on 64 bits operating systems.\n\n\n===================================================================================\n===================================================================================\n\n\n@@@ Requirement @@@\n\n\nIntel Pentium 3\nRam 256 MB\n\n\n===================================================================================\n===================================================================================\n\n\n\n@@@ ScreenShot @@@\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img810.imageshack.us/img810/7706/96917145.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img810.imageshack.us/img810/7706/96917145.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n===================================================================================\n===================================================================================\n\n\n@@@ Inside RAR File @@@\n\n\n\n1. trjsetup682.exe\n2.
