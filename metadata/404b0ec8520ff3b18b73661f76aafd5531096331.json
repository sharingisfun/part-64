But this time they      \n   won't be working on their own; they will have to work in teams and    \n     decide between themselves who will be the team leader. Craig is     \n       paired with Matcho and is concerned about working with the        \n        European Extravaganza - can he reign in Matcho's creative        \n    energies? No sooner is it decided that Johnny will be the leader     \n     than Claire takes the reigns. Will this be one partnership that     \n    ends in tears? Once at Rathdowne, it soon becomes clear that not     \n     all the designers are familiar with their chosen decade, and to     \n    make matters worse, once they get into the workroom, Alex throws     \n    them another curve ball. Who will put their differences aside and    \n       wow the judges, and who will be out?
