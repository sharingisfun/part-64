A notte alta (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“In deepest nightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢), which Casella described as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“the only piece of programme music I have ever composedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦inspired by emotional events in my personal lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (CasellaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s love for his Parisian student Yvonne MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ller), is a work of intimate self-revelation and sombre meditation on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“the utter indifference of Nature to human passionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.
