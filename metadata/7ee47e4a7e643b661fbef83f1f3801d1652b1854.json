Pirro accepts the     \n    proposal and convinces Glauco with a trick: he hits him on his head.     \n    The ship lands at a strange place where Pirro and the other men          \n    aboard are drugged and find themselves in the hands of the Amazons.      \n    Only Glauco escapes, saved from the Egyptian inventor Sofo and he        \n    falls in love with Antiope. Between loves and duels, conspiracies and    \n    ruses, the pirates will bring together Amazons and Greeks.               \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
