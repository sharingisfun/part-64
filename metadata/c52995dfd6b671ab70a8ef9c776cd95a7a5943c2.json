Here grows virtually indestructible, fast-growing grasses of all sizes that feed the planet's largest herbivore populations, the preys to solitary and social carnivores. Spectacular elements of the seasonal cycle of life can include mass migrations, monsoons, drought and great fires.\n\nEpisode 8: Jungles\nOn 3% of the Earth's surface, the rain forest is the habitat for half our animal species, even 80% of insects. So its wildlife is most competitive, like the birds of paradise's mating, and specialized with unique relationships of predation, parasitism etc. For plants, the quest for light is key to stratification, paralleled by interacting animals eating fruits, leaves and other animals. Even the jungle cacophony is stratified. On the soil, recycling specialist like fungi restart the cycle of life. In Central Africa even herds of elephants specialize in following self-made forest paths.\n\nEpisode 9: Shallow Seas\nShallow seas cover only 8% of earth's surface, but contain the richest, most varied maritime life: from plankton and coral (literally vital for the very existence of reefs) to birds and from various invertebrates to mammals like seals, dolphins and whales and from sea snakes to countless fish species. Their ecological interaction is greatly varied and complex, often with nearby land to, even with deserts.\n\nFormat: Matroska\n\nVideo\nFormat/Info: Advanced Video Codec\nSome Encoding settings: qp=15 / ip_ratio=1.30 / pb_ratio=1.30\n\nAudio\nFormat/Info: Digital Theater Systems\nChannel(s): 6 channels\nLanguage: English\n\nText\nFormat: PGS\nCodec ID/Info: The same subtitle format used on BDs/HD-DVDs\nLanguage: English\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c52995dfd6b671ab70a8ef9c776cd95a7a5943c2","amp;dn":"Planet+Earth+SE+2010+Disc3+Blu-ray+720p+x264+DTS-MAXiMiZE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c52995dfd6b671ab70a8ef9c776cd95a7a5943c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,41,149,223,214,182,113,171,112,168,239,156,119,108,217,90,122,89,67,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
