A few overdone standards -- &quot;Rock Me Baby,&quot; &quot;Woke Up This Morning,&quot; &quot;Next Time You See Me&quot; -- intrude a bit, but Odom's own &quot;Bad Feelin',&quot; &quot;Why Did You Leave Me,&quot; and &quot;Come to Me&quot; make impassioned amends. Steve Freund, best-known for his long stint with Sunnyland Slim, contributes stellar lead guitar. ~ Bill Dahl Rolling Stone\n\nTracklist\n1. You Don't Have To Go - 4:02\n2.
