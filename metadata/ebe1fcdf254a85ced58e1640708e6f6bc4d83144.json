Pop, as he calls himself, tells the family a tall tale about the son he lost to illness. The family feels sorry for him and befriends him . . . not knowing the danger that is soon to come to them. In reality, his son Bernie is crazy and dangerous and kept straight-jacketed and chained up in Pop's trailer. Pop lets Bernie out only to stalk and harm campers while Pop helps himself to their belongings.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240736&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240736&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebe1fcdf254a85ced58e1640708e6f6bc4d83144","amp;dn":"Moonstalker+%281989%29%28DVDRip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebe1fcdf254a85ced58e1640708e6f6bc4d83144","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,225,252,223,37,74,133,206,213,142,22,64,112,142,111,107,196,216,49,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
