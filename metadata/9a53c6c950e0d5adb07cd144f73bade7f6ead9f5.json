Because of this the mkv is sligthly\n       &quot;undersized&quot;.\n                \n    Why doesn't everything get released as BD5/BD9?\n           \n    -&gt; We don't know and there is no logical reason. However, as time goes on other\n       groups cannot continue to ignore the bluray community by stubbornly releasing\n       incompatible BluRay releases. It's like releasing DVDR's that don't run in\n       DVD Players.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a53c6c950e0d5adb07cd144f73bade7f6ead9f5","amp;dn":"Top+Cat+-+The+Movie+1080p+%28MKV+%2B+BD5%29+%28English%2FSpanish+5.1%29+%28PS3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a53c6c950e0d5adb07cd144f73bade7f6ead9f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,83,198,201,80,224,213,173,176,124,209,68,247,59,173,231,246,234,217,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
