If you've         \n         ever seen Masters Of The Universe, the live action film.     \n         you know the sort we're thinking of. By 1990, their          \n         production company Cannon Films had been sold, and the       \n         new owner had also bought another company, 21st Century      \n         Film Corporation, in a bankruptcy sale. He handed the        \n         reigns to Golan, and put him in charge of making him         \n         some money.                                                  \n                                                                      \n           Part of his scheme to do so, was to continue licensing     \n         well-known properties, such as Captain America and           \n         Spider-Man, and turn them into feature films. The            \n         production of Spider-Man had previously turned into a        \n         farcical saga similar to the Fantastic Four movie a few      \n         years later, but ended up never actually entering            \n         production. Captain America however did get produced,        \n         and the result is what we're presenting today.               \n                                                                      \n           While arguably a high-budget production by previous        \n         Cannon standards, it had all the markings of a low           \n         budget, and received precious little attention upon          \n         release. Directed by Albert Pyun, the B-movie workhorse      \n         behind titles such as Cyborg and Alien from L.A.,            \n         Captain America was never destined to become a cinema        \n         classic, nor did it, as it came and went virtually           \n         unnoticed in its highly limited theatrical release.          \n                                                                      \n           Possibly the most interesting thing about Captain          \n         America in its 1990 incarnation, besides the background      \n         of its production, is its title actor. Matt Salinger         \n         didn't have much of a prior career to speak of, his          \n         biggest role having been as a jock in his debut Revenge      \n         of the Nerds, and Captain America was anything but the       \n         breakthrough he might have hoped for. While still            \n         working today, he will probably always be known              \n         primarily as the only son of J.D. Salinger.                  \n                                                                      \n                      Enjoy!                                          \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                               WHO WE ARE                             \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to preserving         \n         the neglected titles of an entertainment era long gone.      \n         A time of classic kids flicks, painstaking hand-drawn        \n         animation and countless cheesy low-budget horrors. A         \n         time when pop had a King, and rock had a Queen. A time       \n         when special FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of       \n         their many tools.                                            \n                                                                      \n           Driven by nostalgia and memories of better days, we        \n         seek to relive those times, and share those memories.        \n         While our belief is that the 80s represent the very          \n         pinnacle of pop culture, we will not limit ourselves         \n         to one decade, or any single genre. We will not ignore       \n         the movies considered insignificant or even embarrassing     \n         by the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece just       \n         because it is dated.                                         \n                                                                      \n           Whereas most groups rely solely on digital sources,        \n         there are still thousands of rare and out of print           \n         titles, many of which have no planned digital release.       \n         We've made it our mission to dig these out, clean them       \n         up using the best hardware and techniques available to       \n         us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS, Laserdisc      \n         or more exotic formats, we're here to bring you the best     \n         (and worst!) of decades past. So sit back and enjoy as       \n         we uncover and pay tribute to an age of cinema we will       \n         never get back.                                              \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                                 THANKS                               \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           To everyone that has supported us over the years and       \n         managed to keep this fun!                                    \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n            AEN  AEROHOLiCS  SChiZO  FLS  SiCK  BLooDWeiSeR           \n                                                                      \n            FiCO  TheWretched  VH-PROD  HUMANiSM  BLooDLiTE           \n                                                                      \n            EPiSODE  VoMiT  ALLiANCE  FRAGMENT  SAPHiRE  xV           \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                  \n                           \n                                 \n                      nFO: asphyx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:728d1e57854a8d4bb1a2a3f2a2564d5698470eb4","amp;dn":"Captain.America.1990.LASERDISC.XviD-FLAiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"728d1e57854a8d4bb1a2a3f2a2564d5698470eb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,141,30,87,133,74,141,75,177,162,163,242,162,86,77,86,152,71,14,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
