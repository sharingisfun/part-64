Co-leader of Franco-Finnish-Swedish quartet, The Olding/Kannaste Four, with Finnish saxophone player/ composer Jussi Kannaste. Formerly very active in the free music scene, having played with musicians like Mats Gustafsson, Raymond Strid, Luc Houtkamp (NL), Sten Sandell, Martin Kuchen and Rhodri Davies (UK). Also working as a composer/arranger, scoring for short films and has done writing for string quartets, big bands and full orchestras.\n(hansolding.com)\n\n- - -\n\nThe group consists of four of its generations most hard working musicians in Sweden and has created its own, unique space in European jazz, with a personal and contemporary sound, outside of the main stream. A great sensibility for the inner being of jazz is always present in their music, which is based in thorough compositional work and an almost intuitive interplay. Melodic, hard swinging, contemporary jazz with one foot in the tradition, the other in our time and with the aim steadily fixed into the future!\n\nHans Olding is one of Swedens most active and acclaimed jazz guitarists. He has been heard on stages around Europe and the rest of the world during the last ten years. Well known musicians he has played with includes, Daniel Humair (FRA), Francesco Bearzatti (ITA), Mikko Innanen (FIN), Karl-Martin Almqvist (SWE) and others. He has also received numerous grants for performance and composition.\n\nLinus Lindblom, saxophone, is one of the clearest sounding voices on the Swedish jazz scene today and was recently awarded the Swedish National Radios jazz price as Newcomer of the year. Hes a highly personal musician with a lyrical and energetic sound.\n\nPÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r-Ola Landin, bass, can be heard on several recordings and on scenes around Sweden in different well-established bands. Hes one of the most in demand bass players of his generation in Sweden and has a long list of merits. Hes a thoroughly musical bassist with a rare drive and lots of experience from touring all over the world.\n\nChris Montgomery, drums, is probably the strongest and most exciting drummer emerging from the Swedish west coast. He is one of his generations biggest talents, playing regularly with top creative Swedish jazz groups all over Europe. Singers, Rigmor Gustafsson and Jeanette LindstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶m, as well as the BohuslÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤n Big Band are some of his recent employers.\n(svenskjazz.se)\n\n\n- - -\n\nGruppen utÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶kas med vibrafonisten Mattias StÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥hl i tvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ melodier. Klarinettisten Fredrik Ljungkvist medverkar i en melodi. All musik ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r skriven av Olding. Det ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r en modern jazz som presenteras dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r kompositionerna knappast intar nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥gra publikflirtande vinklingar. Men jag vill definitivt inte kalla musiken svÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rtillgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nglig. HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r handlar det mer om tillit till den egna identiteten utan spekulativa tillsatser. Gruppens vidare ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶den ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r svÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rt att fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rutspÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥. Den seriÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶sa instÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤llningen och musikernas  personliga spel borgar fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶r kommande lagrar.\n\nOldings gitarr och Linus skÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶na ton ger gruppen en tilltalande vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤lljudande klang vilket ocksÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ kunde konstateras pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ den tidigare skivan No Space. BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥da har ett uttryckssÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤tt som frapperar och lockar. Gruppens bakre delar, Per-Ola och Chris, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r alert inspirerande och skapar en bra groove nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r tempot stiger. Mattias vibrafon ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r en tillgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ng och bidrar till att fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rga klangen i de nummer han deltar i. Fredrik Ljungkvist klarinett hade jag gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rna sett lite ymnigare. Han ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r verkligen en speleman, en positiv sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥dan, som sprudlar av leklust peppat med fantasirika inpass.
