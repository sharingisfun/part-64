Bringing two dead scientists (Michael Rennie and Karin Dor) back to life, they use their knowledge to re-animate various earth monsters, including the werewolf Waldemar Daninsky, Frankenstein's monster, the mummy Tao-Tet, and the vampire Count de Meirhoff.\n\nThis is a Widescreen English language version. NOT the choppy UAV video. I spent a long time trying to fix this up. Crop off the annoying red and blue bars on the sides, Play with the quality. It is far from perfect. But probably the best looking copy you will find. So I don't want to hear any bitching about it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e91bb94bf7144731a9c85dd635329f8d4914135","amp;dn":"Assignment+Terror++1970+%28Widescreen+English%29+Paul+Naschy+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e91bb94bf7144731a9c85dd635329f8d4914135","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,145,187,148,191,113,68,115,26,156,133,221,99,83,41,248,212,145,65,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
