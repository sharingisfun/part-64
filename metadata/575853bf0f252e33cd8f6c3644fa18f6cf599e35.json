Roberta, Peter, and Phyllis were very happy living in a comfortable house surrounded by a cook and servants and two loving parents, until one evening when there was a knock at the door and their father was mysteriously taken away by two men. Suddenly alone, their mother moves the family to a small cottage in the countryside. There, the children begin a series of exciting adventures, from saving a train filled with passengers from a landslide, to rescuing a baby from a fire, to aiding a penniless Russian exile, to eventually unravelling the mystery of their father's disappearance.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:575853bf0f252e33cd8f6c3644fa18f6cf599e35","amp;dn":"The+Railway+Children+-+E+Nesbit+++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"575853bf0f252e33cd8f6c3644fa18f6cf599e35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,88,83,191,15,37,46,51,205,143,108,54,68,250,24,246,207,89,158,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
