This project to unilaterally, totally control information flow is a product of complex, ongoing interplay between technological, political, legal, corporate, economic, and social factors, including research and development of advanced, digital technologies; an unremitting ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwar on terrorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½; relaxed surveillance laws; government alliances with information technology companies; mass media manipulation; and corporate globalism.
