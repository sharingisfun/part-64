It is a complete remake of Counter-Strike using the Source game engine. As in the original, Counter-Strike: Source pits a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won either by completing an objective (such as detonating a bomb or rescuing hostages) or by eliminating all members of the opposing team.\n\nGameplay\n\nCounter-Strike: Source is a remake of Counter-Strike, and retains its team-based objective-oriented first-person shooter style gameplay. The aim of playing a map is to accomplish a map's objective: defusing the bomb, rescuing all hostages, or killing the entire opposing team. The ultimate goal of the game is to win more rounds than the opposing team. Once players are killed, they do not respawn until the next round on most servers. This gameplay feature distinguishes Counter-Strike from other first-person shooter games, where players respawn instantly or after a short delay.\nMoving and shooting also work differently than they do in other first-person shooters. Shooting while moving dramatically decreases accuracy, and holding the trigger down to continuously shoot produces severe recoil. This can be difficult for beginning players to compensate for because the player's crosshair does not correspond with where the bullets actually hit. Shot damage depends upon where the bullet hits, with hits to the head often being lethal.\n\nNote : The Game Is Creacked &amp; Ready For Action! Just Uncompress And Play . . .\n\nScreenshots :\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://pcmedia.ign.com/pc/image/article/554/554955/counter-strike-source-20041007002320463_640w.jpg&quot;&gt;Screenshot 1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;a2&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1-games.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/10-174_1.jpg&quot;&gt;Screenshot 3&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94f483134eb4bdf4c07e2bf24ac1e621602e108d","amp;dn":"Counter+Strike+Source+Cracked+%26+Ready","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94f483134eb4bdf4c07e2bf24ac1e621602e108d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,244,131,19,78,180,189,244,192,126,43,242,74,193,230,33,96,46,16,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
