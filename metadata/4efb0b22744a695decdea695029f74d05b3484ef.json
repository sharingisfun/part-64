During the early and mid-'60s, he worked with such R&amp;B/soul greats as Little Richard, the Isley Brothers, and King Curtis as a backup guitarist. Occasionally he recorded as a session man (the Isley Brothers' 1964 single &quot;Testify&quot; is the only one of these early tracks that offers even a glimpse of his future genius). But the stars didn't appreciate his show-stealing showmanship, and Hendrix was straight-jacketed by sideman roles that didn't allow him to develop as a soloist. The logical step was for Hendrix to go out on his own, which he did in New York in the mid-'60s, playing with various musicians in local clubs, and joining white blues-rock singer John Hammond, Jr.'s band for a while. \n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nSeventeen songs from 1967 BBC broadcasts, when the Jimi Hendrix Experience had yet to burn out from the wheel of constant touring, management hassles, and internal strife. They're in good, enthusiastic form as they run through early gems like &quot;Hey Joe,&quot; &quot;Foxy Lady,&quot; &quot;Fire,&quot; and &quot;Stone Free,&quot; the lack of studio polish giving these versions a loose feel. The Experience studio albums are still considerably superior to this set, but it's certainly worth acquiring by any serious Hendrix fan, not least because it has several covers that didn't make it on to the three proper Experience LPs. Several of these (&quot;Hoochie Koochie Man,&quot; &quot;Killing Floor,&quot; &quot;Catfish Blues&quot;) reveal his sometimes overlooked affinity for Chicago-style electric blues; there are also a couple of surprises (&quot;Hound Dog&quot; and &quot;Day Tripper&quot;). With good sound, it's a solid addition to the Hendrix library, demonstrating his versatility in various rock, soul, and blues styles.\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01. Stone Free\n02.
