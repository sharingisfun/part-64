This means the recording occasionally distorts when the audience claps or cheers loudly and you can hear the bar noise in the background. I also had a last minute microphone malfunction so had to resort to using the internal speakers of my gadget.\n\nOverall though, the recording scrubs up not too badly, so if you can live with the faults, it's still well worth a listen.\n\n\nAlso includes a newspaper review and a ticket pic.\n\n\n\nTufty - August 2011 \t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e7eeb983b4ca5be885e73b2c91736f06b038fc4","amp;dn":"Tom+Green-Udderbelly+Edinburgh+Festival-+8th+August+2011-MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e7eeb983b4ca5be885e73b2c91736f06b038fc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,126,235,152,59,76,165,190,136,94,115,178,201,23,54,240,107,3,143,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
