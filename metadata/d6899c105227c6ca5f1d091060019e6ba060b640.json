This film goes deeper than the vague predictions made by ancient prophets and seers; it explores how the earth is in the middle of a transformation that will change the way we live our lives forever.\n\n\nUnderstand how the changes we see around us are unfolding right now. Learn the true nature of the Mayan Calendar, understand the workings and meanings of its cycles and end-date, and see that not only did the Maya track and measure time, cycles and nature, but they charted a galactic alignment that occurs once every 26,000 years.\n\n\nFeaturing the leading authors in the 2012 genre, including David Icke, Patrick Geryl, Adrian Gilbert, Geoff Stray, Gregg Braden, Annabel Burton, Peter Taylor and John Major Jenkins.\nProduced by Winterhill Productions over a period of 18 months while travelling around the globe interviewing the experts. \n\n\n\n\n\nDirected by: David Morris\n=========================\n\n\nWritten by: Christopher Turner\n==============================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    2012 An Awakening\nYear.................:    2009\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:09:17\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3)\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    4:3\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    640x480\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1610 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A) \nFile Size:...........:    798 MB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2009  \n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1458390/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1458390/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            *** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6899c105227c6ca5f1d091060019e6ba060b640","amp;dn":"2012+An+Awakening-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6899c105227c6ca5f1d091060019e6ba060b640","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,137,156,16,82,39,198,202,95,29,9,16,96,1,158,107,160,96,182,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
