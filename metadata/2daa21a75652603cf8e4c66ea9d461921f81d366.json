Each is obsessed with his separate mission, and guided by the wisdom of The Bartender (Woody Harrelson) at the Horseless Horseman Saloon, the two eventually join forces to bring down the corrupt and contemptuous reign of Nicola (Ron Perlman), the awesomely evil &quot;woodcutter&quot; and his lady Alexandra (Demi Moore), a femme fatale with a secret past. This classic tale is re-vitalized and re-imagined in an entirely fresh visual context, set in a unique world that mixes skewed reality with shadow-play fantasy, a place where even the landscape can betray you. Heroes triumph here only because the force of their will transforms and transcends both space and time. The world of BUNRAKU is past and present, fantasy and reality, Samurai and Western all combined. Like SIN CITY and 300, it gives classic conflict a whole new graphically supercharged dynamic. Resonating through a wide range of cultures and showcasing a mind-blowing array of martial arts disciplines, BUNRAKU is a fresh arena for breathtaking fight action.\n\nGenre: Action Adventure Drama\n\nDirector: Guy Moshe\n\nCast: Josh Hartnett, Woody Harrelson, Gackt, Demi Moore, Ron Perlman, Kevin McKidd\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nVideo: Xvid 1920x800 23.98fps\n\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 320kbps\n___________________________________________________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2daa21a75652603cf8e4c66ea9d461921f81d366","amp;dn":"Bunraku.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%5BHD%5D+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2daa21a75652603cf8e4c66ea9d461921f81d366","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,170,33,167,86,82,96,60,248,228,198,110,169,212,97,146,31,129,211,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
