Mono Record #REB 400]\n\nThis torrent contains two files. Side 1 complete and Side 2 complete. They are recorded as they were meant to be heard with no gaps between tracks, indeed the tracks are often super-imposed over each other.\n\nThis show was a satirical look at current events and brings back memories of how we felt about world leaders of the time [and how we even laughed at Mrs Thatcher for a while]. With Rowan Atkinson, Griff Rhys Jones, Mel Smith, Pamela Stevenson.\n\nRecorded using Audacity from an Amstrad Studio 100 by Machloop.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2cdc777cd6aff3756b0784450cb9acc9277d9d7","amp;dn":"Not+the+9+oclock+News","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2cdc777cd6aff3756b0784450cb9acc9277d9d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,205,199,119,205,106,255,55,86,176,120,68,80,203,154,204,146,119,217,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
