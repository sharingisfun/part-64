Advertising executive Nick Beame (Tim Robbins) is not having a good day when he comes home from work to discover that his wife Ann (Kelly Preston) is having an affair with another man -- who, adding insult to injury, happens to be his boss, Phillip Barrow (Michael McKean). Deeply depressed, Nick hops into his SUV and starts driving aimlessly. He ends up in a rough neighborhood where a carjacker, T. Paul (Martin Lawrence), pulls a gun and jumps in the passenger seat. Nick grumbles &quot;Boy, did you pick the wrong guy on the wrong day,&quot; and, thinking he has no reason to live, heads out to the desert over T. Paul's objections. Nick learns that T. Paul is actually a family man who has turned to crime because he can't get a job. Nick offers to help T. Paul, though crime is not one of his strong suits, and things get even more complicated when a pair of crooks, Rig (John C. McGinley) and Charlie (Giancarlo Esposito), start following them. \n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 38 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\nFrame Width: 640\n\nFrame Height: 272\n\nFrame Rate: 59fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 114kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55e65d6e367d718774492f181b934a5d880e6cc5","amp;dn":"Nothing+to+Lose%281997%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55e65d6e367d718774492f181b934a5d880e6cc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,230,93,110,54,125,113,135,116,73,47,24,27,147,74,93,136,14,108,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
