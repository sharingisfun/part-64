The VHD can be used as the running operating system on supported hardware without a virtual machine or hypervisor. This provides an excellent way for end users who wish to utilize the VHD technology and setup a multi-boot environment with Windows XP and Windows Vista without having to &quot;Upgrade&quot; or repartition the hard disk.\n\nPortlock Leap Frog has been developed and designed to provide end users the ability to utilize the new VHD-boot capabilities in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 in one easy to use wizard. Portlock Leap Frog eliminates steps for VHD-boot setup such as the need to first boot the system to the Windows install DVD as well as the use of tools such as the &quot;Disk Management&quot; console and command prompt tools such as &quot;Diskpart&quot; and &quot;BCDedit.&quot;\n\nTop Features\n\nCreate Windows 7 VHD Boot\nCreate a Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 bootable VHD to multi-boot with nearly any Windows OS.\n\nCompact VHD\nCompact a virtual disk to improve performance or to prepare a virtual disk for shrinking.\n\n\nBoot Manager\nInstall/update Windows Boot Manager and setup a multi-boot environment with many VHDs.\n\nBootable CD\nA bootable ISO file based upon WinPE 2.1 provides the ability to hard-boot a system and run Portlock Leap Frog.\n\n\nControl Panel\nManage Portlock Leap Frog features from the Portlock icon, located in the Windows notification area.\n\nAttach VHD\nAttach a VHD to any of the supported client operating systems.\n\n\nResize VHD\nResize both &quot;Dynamic&quot; and &quot;Fixed&quot; VHDs.\n\nCreate VHD\nCreate a fixed or dynamic VHD.\n\n\nMultilingual Support\nPortlock Leap Frog supports displaying in English, Spanish, Japanese and Chinese.\n\nMount ISO Image\nMount ISO files for the extraction of files and folders.\n\nHome Page - http://www.portlock.com/products/leap_frog/\n\n\nVT result for the patch\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=972087c4c737ac38c8889b72c3e9c53c0525149ad622a6cf89cc582efeaafb35-1312407591&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=972087c4c737ac38c8889b72c3e9c53c0525149ad622a6cf89cc582efeaafb35-1312407591&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n*** When using TPB please read these important notes: \n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n01. AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their \n    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02. To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03. If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04. To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6487418&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6487418&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05. Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06. Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07. Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08. Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09. Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10. Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11. In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12. In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13. Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n14. Comments are welcome, unlike ranting, trolling, whining, etc.\n\n15. No Promises ... No Debts!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:                                 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor requests:                                &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=31&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=31&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my 1100+ torrents:                                 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally \nposting fake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just trying to spread \nconfusion and to frustrate TPB and it's users. \nLess downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\t\t\t\n\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24ab8c60951fed9880985bf2f39ff9af12472c92","amp;dn":"Portlock+Leap+Frog+x86+v5.13.0.26.08-RESURRECTiON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24ab8c60951fed9880985bf2f39ff9af12472c92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,171,140,96,149,31,237,152,128,152,91,242,243,159,249,175,18,71,44,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
