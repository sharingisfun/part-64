Frustrated with her life, Casey throws a coffee at the wall of the Krowne Donuts where she works ... and the splash (with a little help from Casey) seems to resemble an image of Jesus Christ. Overnight, Casey finds herself becoming the ring-master of a growing faith circus: the parking-lot teems in new customers, 24-7 news media arrive. Casey's hoax changes everything: for her strict, fundamental boss, her sweet, believing boyfriend, her &quot;Doubting Thomas&quot; local priest, and, most importantly, for her Dad ... Haunted by the aftermath of a family tragedy, Casey's Dad is letting everything around him go: his mortgage payments, his business, everything. Casey's hoax might be just the &quot;divine intervention&quot; which her Dad needs ... but the results are not at all what she expected.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbe79b2996f58dacf016ed4b61cb0633d3b8f7bd","amp;dn":"Faith+Fraud+and+Minimum+Wage+%282010%29+%5BDVDRip-400mb%5D+BHATTI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbe79b2996f58dacf016ed4b61cb0633d3b8f7bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,231,155,41,150,245,141,172,240,22,237,75,97,203,6,51,211,184,247,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
