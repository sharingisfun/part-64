They claim that these three religions stand for the same belief that there is One God and should unite in their call for the implementation of great moral values. Some of those involved call for the establishment of centers containing churches, synagogues, and masaajid side by side, and printing the QurÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢an, the Bible, and the Torah in one binding, etc. In the name of defending Islam against political and media distortions in the West, some organizations are compromising the basics of the Islamic creed through what is called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBridging the Faiths.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ This is a very dangerous call because it mixes the truth with falsehood and thus practically implies the elimination of the truth perfected in the deen of Islam. The Christians and Jews want the Muslims to be like them. That is why they support this deceptive call for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œunityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2b0822b110bde0eba58c3906c116a4d352fbc0c","amp;dn":"The+Call+for+the+Unity+of+Religions%3A+A+False+and+Dangerous+Call","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2b0822b110bde0eba58c3906c116a4d352fbc0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,176,130,43,17,11,222,14,186,88,195,144,108,17,106,77,53,47,188,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
