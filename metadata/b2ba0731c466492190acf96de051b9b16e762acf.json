It is the third film directed by Gray, and the second film to feature Phoenix and Wahlberg together, the first being The Yards. The film's title comes from the motto of the NYPD's Street Crimes Unit, which disbanded in 2002. Brooklyn, 1988. Crime is rife, especially drugs and drug violence. A Russian thug is building his heroin trade, while everyone laughs at the cops. Brothers have chosen different paths: Joe has followed his father Bert into New York's Finest; he's a rising star. Bobby, who uses his mother's maiden name, manages a club. Bobby too is on the rise: he has a new girlfriend and a green-light to develop a Manhattan club. Joe and Bert ask him to help with intelligence gathering; he declines. Then, Joe raids Bobby's club to arrest the Russian. From there, things spiral out of control: the Russian puts out a hit on Joe, personal losses mount, and Bobby's loyalties face the test.\n\nCAST:\nJoaquin Phoenix as Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Green/Grusinsky\nMark Wahlberg as Captain Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Grusinsky\nEva Mendes as Amada Juarez\nRobert Duvall as Deputy Chief Albert &quot;Burt&quot; Grusinsky\n\n\nDETAILS:\nEnglish\n118 Minutes\nIMDB: tt0498399\n\nPRODUCT DESCRIPTION: What if your own family stood in the way of everything you worked for? Bobby Green (Joaquin Phoenix) has forsaken his name to escape his family and their tradition in law enforcement to pursue his ambitions as a Brooklyn nightclub owner.
