Upbeat, catchy dance songs fronted by Blanche Le Blanc and Phil Bimstein with Eric Kister (guitar), Bill Hyland (bass) and Roman Zabicki (drums) rounding out the band. They recorded two singles and two albums for Pink Records and appeared on a team-up disc with The Wild Stares for Trouser Press. Heard primarily on national college radio and local stations WXRT in Chicago and KROQ in Los Angeles, they even had a few MTV videos that you can find on YouTube. \n\nThey hit their stride in the catchy Lands And Peoples in 1982.\n\nIncluded here:\n- Auto-sex b/w PRL-853 (single, 1980)\n- I Want Some More b/w IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m Losing Interest (single, 1981)\n- Multiple Choice (LP, 1980)\n- Lands and Peoples (LP, 1982)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfe8a56733e8d9e9e87c3cdd2a1d56a3ebd052dd","amp;dn":"Phil+%5C%27n+The+Blanks+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfe8a56733e8d9e9e87c3cdd2a1d56a3ebd052dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,232,165,103,51,232,217,233,232,124,60,221,42,29,86,163,235,208,82,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
