New gameplay additions include an item called the \\\\\\&quot;hookblade\\\\\\&quot;, which can be used to zipline across the city or grab enemies to yank them in for a combo attack. The hookblade reportedly speeds up navigation by around 30 percent.[6] Along with the hookblade, Ezio also has around 150 different bomb variations at his disposal, which are to be crafted.[7] The game features new \\\\\\&quot;Desmond Sequences\\\\\\&quot;, \\\\\\&quot;Dali-esque\\\\\\&quot; first-person platforming missions in a radical departure for the series.[8]\nAlso added and expanded are seizing districts of the city from the Templars. While capturing a district is very similar to Brotherhood, the Templars will attempt to recapture districts, which Ezio must defend using a \\\\\\&quot;tower defense\\\\\\&quot; minigame, where he controls a group of Assassins from rooftops against several waves of Templar soldiers and siege equipment. Similar to Brotherhood, initiates can be sent on missions to other regions, eventually wresting control from the Templars, and then using the city to produce a stream of income and new Assassin recruits.\n\nXP/vista/win7","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2695900e25db10f5f71fbc9d2bf136c0320d89e","amp;dn":"Assassins+Creed+Revelations+%5BzZSilentSnakeZz%5D.repack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2695900e25db10f5f71fbc9d2bf136c0320d89e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,105,89,0,226,93,177,15,95,113,251,201,210,191,19,108,3,32,216,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
