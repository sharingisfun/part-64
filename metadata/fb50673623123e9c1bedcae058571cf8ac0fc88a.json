They had always assumed that their father, a successful physician, was well-off but they learn that he also had a secret life and spent most of his fortune. The immediate problem is financial as they search for work but their father had forced them to live a very sheltered life and they're really not qualified to do much of anything. Through good luck, a new friend introduces them to her brother, Jack Maddox, a well-known society photographer who is in need of a receptionist.\n\nI don't know much about this. The Wife asked for it for Christmas as we couldn't find it on The Bay. Now we have the box set, we give back to the community that has given us so many great TV shows and movies.\n\nThanks to all Pirate Bay Uploaders and seeders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb50673623123e9c1bedcae058571cf8ac0fc88a","amp;dn":"The+House+of+Eliott","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb50673623123e9c1bedcae058571cf8ac0fc88a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,80,103,54,35,18,62,156,27,237,202,224,88,87,28,248,172,15,200,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
