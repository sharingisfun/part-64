Eswar Reddy, &quot;Principles and Perspectives in Cosmochemistry&quot; \n Sp..,.er | 2010 | ISBN: 3642103510 | 440 pages | PDF | 8.95 MB \n\n A fundamental question in contemporary astrophysics is the origin of the elements. Cosmochemistry seeks to answer when, how and where the chemical elements arose. Quantitative answers to these fundamental questions require a multi-disciplinary approach involving stellar evolution, explosive nucleosynthesis and nuclear reactions in different astrophysical environments. There remain, however, many outstanding problems and cosmochemistry remains a fertile area of research. This book is among the first in recent times to put together the essentials of cosmochemistry, combining contributions from leading astrophysicists in the field. The chapters have been organized to provide a clear description of the fundamentals, an introduction to modern techniques such as computational modelling, and glimpses of outstanding issues.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f87620a9878781bb8699d25c6da7a68fa95018b1","amp;dn":"Principles+and+Perspectives+in+Cosmochemistry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f87620a9878781bb8699d25c6da7a68fa95018b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,118,32,169,135,135,129,187,134,153,210,92,109,167,166,143,169,80,24,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
