Lilly - LSD &amp; Dolphin Researcher [study pack]\n\nJohn Cunningham Lilly (January 6, 1915 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ September 30, 2001) was an American physician, neuroscientist, psychoanalyst, psychonaut, philosopher and writer. He was a researcher of the nature of consciousness using mainly isolation tanks, dolphin communication, and psychedelic drugs, sometimes in combination.\n\nLILLY: In the province of the mind what one believes to be true, either is true or becomes true within certain limits. These limits are to be found experimentally and experientially. When so found these limits turn out to be further beliefs to be transcended. In the province of the mind there are no limits. However, in the province of the body there are definite limits not to be transcended.\n\nLILLY: Right. For instance, there's an Iranian psychiatrist, an American psychiatrist, that put a hundred patients in a mental hospital in Iran through what they feared most, on Ketamine, and they all left the hospital. Now, I tried the same thing, after I read that. That evening I took 150 milligrams of Ketamine, and suddenly the Earth Coincidence Control Office removed my penis and handed it to me. I screamed in terror. My wife Toni came running in from the bedroom, and she said, &quot;It's still attached.&quot; So I shouted at the ceiling, &quot;Who's in charge up there? A bunch of crazy kids?&quot; The answer came back, &quot;Well, you had an unconscious fear, so we put you through it, just the way the Iranian psychiatrist did.&quot;\n\nLILLY: Well, you can't live as a human without limits, and that's your body. They're built into your brain. The pattern recognition system is in your brain, for instance. If one hallucinates, say, on cocaine, one sees a bush over there as an old lady crying with a shawl over her head. You walk over and it's a bush. Now if somebody else is on cocaine and they look at that same bush, they'll see the old lady crying. So this apparently is pattern recognition systems that are built into our brains, and are given at birth probably. \n\nFiles: Books, Papers, Audio, Video - see file list","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55dab8bf577fbe1f0c398f431b564936e2ae1f44","amp;dn":"John+C.+Lilly+-+LSD+%26+Dolphin+Researcher+%5Bstudy+pack%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55dab8bf577fbe1f0c398f431b564936e2ae1f44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,218,184,191,87,127,190,31,12,57,143,67,27,86,73,54,226,174,31,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
