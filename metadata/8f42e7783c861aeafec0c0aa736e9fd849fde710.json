Was he a terrorist as he claimed, a madman, or was he indeed both?\n\nThe film will have first-hand accounts from eyewitnesses and survivors who have not spoken on camera before. Including:\n\n- taxi driver Arild Tangen who was the last man to speak to Breivik before his attack;\n\n- survivor Adrian Pracon who was shot in the shoulder and tried to swim away from the island. He pleaded with Breivik to spare him;\n\n- BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸rn Kasper Ilaug who rescued some of the kids whilst the shooting was happening by pulling bodies on to his boat;\n\n- and Brede Joherraaten ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Camp owner, was there and recovered bodies and saved swimmers.\n\nThe killerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s action are analysed by a host of experts, including: renowned criminologist Professor David Wilson; Katherine Newman from Princeton university who is one of worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the top experts on spree shootings; Matthew Goodman, the leading authority on British and European right wing terror groups; and terror and weapons expert Charles Shoebridge.\n\nAnd foremost, above all, is the memory of those who died. What were the warning signs? What could have been done? By investigating this appalling crime, there is the hope that an atrocity like this can never happen again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f42e7783c861aeafec0c0aa736e9fd849fde710","amp;dn":"Norway+Massacre%3A+The+Killer%5C%27s+Mind+720p+Discovery+Channel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f42e7783c861aeafec0c0aa736e9fd849fde710","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,66,231,120,60,134,26,234,254,192,192,170,115,110,159,216,73,253,231,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
