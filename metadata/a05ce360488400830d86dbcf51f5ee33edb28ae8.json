Lewis's determination to bear witness to the desperate plight of so many in Africa and elsewhere is balanced by his unique, personal, and often searing insider's perspective on our ongoing failure to help.\n\nLewis recounts how, in 2000, the United Nations Millennium Summit in New York introduced eight Millennium Development Goals, which focused on fundamental issues such as education, health, and cutting poverty in half by 2015. In audacious prose, alive with anecdotes ranging from maddening to hilarious to heartbreaking, Lewis shows why and how the international community is falling desperately short of these goals.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/ideas/massey-archives/2005/11/07/massey-lectures-2005-race-against-time/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/ideas/massey-archives/2005/11/07/massey-lectures-2005-race-against-time/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a05ce360488400830d86dbcf51f5ee33edb28ae8","amp;dn":"2005+Massey+Lectures+-+Race+Against+Time+by+Stephen+Lewis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a05ce360488400830d86dbcf51f5ee33edb28ae8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,92,227,96,72,132,0,131,13,134,219,207,81,245,238,51,237,178,138,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
