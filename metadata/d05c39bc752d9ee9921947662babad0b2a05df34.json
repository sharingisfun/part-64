A beleaguered church, deeming sorcery the culprit of the plague, commands the two knights to transport an accused witch to a remote abbey, where monks will perform a ritual in hopes of ending the pestilence. A priest, a grieving knight, a disgraced itinerant and a headstrong youth who can only dream of becoming a knight join a mission troubled by mythically hostile wilderness and fierce contention over the fate of the girl. When the embattled party arrives at the abbey, a horrific discovery jeopardises the knight's pledge to ensure the girl fair treatment, and pits them against an inexplicably powerful and destructive force.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d05c39bc752d9ee9921947662babad0b2a05df34","amp;dn":"SEASON_OF_THE_WITCH.ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d05c39bc752d9ee9921947662babad0b2a05df34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,92,57,188,117,45,158,233,146,25,71,102,43,171,173,11,42,5,223,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
