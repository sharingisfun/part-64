The album was recorded at Le \n\nStudio, Morin Heights, Quebec, and was mixed at Trident Studios \n\nin London, UK. Permanent Waves became Rush\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s first US Top 5 album \n\nhitting #4 and was the band\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s fifth Gold (eventually Platinum) \n\nselling album. The album also marks a distinct transition from \n\nhard rock and progressive rock into a more accessible, radio-\n\nfriendly style and consequently, a significant expansion in the \n\nband\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s sales with hits such as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;The Spirit of Radio\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; and \n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Freewill\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; seeing considerable radio airplay. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Waves&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Waves&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMusic\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;The Spirit of Radio\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; featured the band\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s early experiments with \n\na reggae style, which was explored further on Moving Pictures and \n\nSignals.\n\nA notable track on Permanent Waves is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Jacob\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Ladder\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, a song \n\nstyle reminiscent of their earlier heavy progressive rock period. \n\nExploring odd time signatures, the song possesses a dark, ominous \n\nfeel. The song\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s lyrics are based on a simple concept; a vision \n\nof sunlight breaking through storm clouds. The title is a \n\nreference to the natural phenomenon of the sun breaking through \n\nthe clouds in visible rays, which in turn is named after the \n\nBiblical ladder to heaven on which Jacob saw angels ascending and \n\ndescending in a vision.\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Entre Nous\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Between Us\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;) is similar in style to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Freewill,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; \n\nyet it did not receive heavy radio airplay, and was not featured \n\nin concerts until the Snakes &amp; Arrows Tour.[3] While the band \n\nbegan stepping back from the epic song format on this album, \n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Natural Science\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; does clock in at over nine minutes and is \n\ncomposed of three distinct movements. The lyrics are driven by \n\nconcepts of natural science. It was featured, with a different \n\narrangement, on every tour from 1996 to 2002, and was also \n\nfeatured on their 2007-2008 Snakes And Arrows tour.\n\nCover art\n\nThe cover art sparked some controversy because of the appearance \n\nof the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Dewey Defeats Truman\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; headline on the newspaper. Because \n\nof pressure from the Chicago Tribune, Hugh Syme changed the text \n\nto \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Dewei Defeats Truman\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;. The billboards in the distance were \n\nchanged from Coca-Cola (who objected to the use of their logo) to \n\ninclude each band member\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s name in similar typestyle.\n\nThe background scene comes from a photo, taken by Flip Schulke, \n\nof the Galveston Seawall in Texas during Hurricane Carla on \n\nSeptember 11, 1961. The woman pictured in the foreground is model \n\nPaula Turnbull.[4] The waving man in the background is Hugh \n\nSyme.[5]\n\nBackground\n\nThe writing of the album began in July 1979, at a farmhouse at \n\nLakewoods Farm in Ontario on Georgian Bay, Lake Huron while Peart \n\nstarted his lyrics in a cottage near there. They began with an \n\ninstrumental jam, which they nicknamed \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Uncle Tounouse\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;. Parts of \n\nthis were used in the songs on the album. While Peart worked on \n\nlyrics, Lifeson and Lee would work on musical ideas in the \n\nbasement. Within a few days they had put together \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;The Spirit of \n\nRadio\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Freewill\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Jacob\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Ladder\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, which came very \n\nnaturally to them, and it was recorded on a Slider JVC mobile \n\nunit. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Entre Nous\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; was the only lyric completed ahead of time.\n\nNeil was working on making a song out of Sir Gawain and the Green \n\nKnight, the medieval epic from King Arthur\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s time. Based on the \n\nstory written in the 14th century, he was trying to keep its \n\noriginal style. It was deemed too out of place with the other \n\nmaterial and was discarded. They moved into Sound Kitchen studio \n\nin Toronto to record demos, joined by producer Terry Brown. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;The \n\nSpirit of Radio\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Freewill\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Jacob\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Ladder\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; were further \n\npolished on the warm-up tour during soundchecks.\n\nIn 1982, Lee told Rolling Stone Magazine that the album\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s title \n\nreferred to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;a theory that was going [within the band] about, \n\nlike, culture waves; and there was a night when Neil said that a \n\nbig album was like a permanent wave and I told him, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s our \n\ntitle.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;[6]\n\nRush headed to Le Studio in Morin Heights, Quebec and began \n\ntweaking the settings of instruments and positioning of \n\nmicrophones. They recorded basic tracks with multiple takes until \n\nthey captured the best performance. While Lee, Lifeson, and Terry \n\nBrown began overdubs, Peart began attempting to write another \n\nepic song to replace the discarded \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Green Knight\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, and after \n\nenduring three days of writer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s block, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Natural Science\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; was \n\nborn. Fin Costello was then brought in to photograph the band in \n\nthe studio. Cover art director Hugh Syme was also brought in and \n\nadded a piano solo to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Different Strings\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;. Music was composed for \n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Natural Science\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, with some leftover parts from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Green Knight\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;. \n\nThe tide pool effects for the song were created by splashing oars \n\nin the private lake, performed by producer Terry Brown and studio \n\nassistant Kim Bickerdike, and the natural echo outside was used \n\nto record various instruments. The rough mixes on the album were \n\ncomplete, and the final mix was completed in a week at Trident \n\nstudios, London.[7][8]\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll music written by Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee.
