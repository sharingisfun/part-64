AND TAX DOLLARS TO HIDE DECADES OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY INSIDE THE CITY AND HIS DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN THE ILLEGAL COVER-UP. HE HAS ISSUED ILLEGAL/UNCONSTITUTIONAL CRIMINAL TRESPASS WARNINGS, CONFISCATED PROOF OF THE CRIMES AND INSTRUCTED CITY COUNCIL/CITY STAFF TO IGNORE REPORTS OF THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. OUR MAYOR, COUNCIL, POLICE DEPARTMENT, CITY MANAGER, OFFICE OF MUNICIPAL INTEGRITY, ETC. GO ALONG WITH THE ILLEGAL COVER-UP. \n\nCITY OF SAN ANTONIO, TEXASÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ FORMER CIO RICHARD VARN ( Richard J H Varn has been allowed to quietly sneak out of the City back to Des Moines, Iowa)  AND OTHER CITY WITNESSES WITH THE ASSISTANCE/COACHING OF CITY ATTORNEY DEBORAH KLEIN COMMITTED SUBORNATION OF PERJURY/AGGRAVATED PERJURY/OBSTRUCTION TO HIDE DECADES OF PUBLIC CORRUPTION, THEFT AND BOND/ACCOUNTING FRAUD\n\n\nCorrupt City of San Antonio, Texas employees have for most of the past three (3) decades secretly dumped invoices, bills, fake statements , etc.  into an internal telephone billing account called the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtelephone variableÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and fraudulently billed individual city departments, grantors and others supposedly for overhead telephone expenses- grant funded, city funded and alternately funded phones alike. These invoices and bills were not for telephone costs, were not associated with state/federal grants, were not the responsibility of the department/entity billed, were altered to hide the true identity of the user, contained known fraudulent accounting of hours worked, were for illegal contracts with unauthorized vendors containing huge markups, were NEVER approved by Council/taxpayers, etc. Fraudulent use of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œvariableÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ violated City Administrative Directives, City ordinances, municipal/state open bidding regulations, state/federal grants rules, etc. Internal City documents describe the magnitude of the fraud as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa bottomless pit of moneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmillions of dollars of goods and servicesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.  Up to $5.2 million a year for every year since 1982 was funneled thru the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œvariableÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½- most of the money for illegal purposes.  City Attorney Bernard, SAPD Chief McAnus,, Bexar County Sheriff Ortiz, Bexar County D A Reed, Texas Rangers (especially Chief Whitman) and local FBI agents (especially agents Brown, Powers, Pratt, Radcliff, Diaz and Nelson) ignore police reports (9.0471467/2009-081395) that were ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œripped upÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, sworn affidavits, Municipal Integrity intake reports and documented evidence of the violations of law and the ensuing perjury/obstruction committed to keep the crimes secret.  All proof of the crimes was confiscated from City Council , instructions were issued by City Attorney Bernard  not to discuss the criminal activity and an unconstitutional ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCriminal trespass WarningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ letter was issued by Bernard and SAPD Chief McAnus barring entry into City Hall, Main Plaza ( City Council chambers), and other city sites. The ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcolor of the lawÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is being used to hide the criminal activity.  They violate the law to hide decades of criminal activity including theft of public funds, bond fraud, accounting fraud, grant fraud, etc.  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce734a87f6b8a10c41ee3801d1c4079e04acef05","amp;dn":"Public+and+Police+Corruption+++++San+Antonio%2C+Texas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce734a87f6b8a10c41ee3801d1c4079e04acef05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,115,74,135,246,184,161,12,65,238,56,1,209,196,7,158,4,172,239,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
