This prompts him to begin therapy with Dr. Jennifer Melfi. Gradually, the storyline reveals details of Tony's upbringing, with his father's influence looming large on his development as a gangster, but more so that Tony's mother, Livia, was vengeful and possibly personality-disordered. His complicated relationship with his wife Carmela is also explored, as well as her feelings regarding her husband's cosa nostra ties. Meadow and Anthony Jr., Tony's children gain increasing knowledge of their father's mob dealings. Later, federal indictments are brought as a result of someone in his organization talking to the FBI and his own Uncle plots Tony's death.\n\nAfter ordering the execution of Brendan Filone and the mock execution of Chris Moltisanti, Tony's Uncle Junior is installed as boss of the family (following the death of previous boss Jackie Aprile, Sr. from cancer), even though Tony actually controls most things from behind the scenes. Furious at Junior's plan to have him killed, Tony responds to the attempt on his life with a violent reprisal and confronts his mother for her role in plotting his downfall. She has a psychologically triggered pseudo-stroke and Junior is arrested by the FBI on non-related charges.\n [/color]\n \nFile: .mp4\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0705224/\n\nYear: 1999\n\nGenre: Crime / Drama \n\nAudio: 128Kbps, 48 KHz, MPEG-4 AAC LC\n\nBit Rate: 1024kbps\n\nVideo Size: 720 x 480\n\nFrame Rate: 23.976 frames/second\n\nLanguage: English\n\nVideo Source: 2404 Kbps, 1280 x 720, 23.976 fps, \nAudio Source: 384Kbps, 48 KHz, AC-3\n\n[color=Red]Screens;[/color]\n[img]http://img842.imageshack.us/img842/9003/vlcsnap2011080412h51m17.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img691.imageshack.us/img691/8639/vlcsnap2011080412h54m58.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img30.imageshack.us/img30/3397/vlcsnap2011080412h58m48.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img851.imageshack.us/img851/3191/vlcsnap2011080412h58m56.png[/img]\n\n[color=Navy][b]This is MP4 format so will play on PS3, iPod, AppleTV etc but is optimized for the PSP[/b][/color]\n\n[b][font=Verdana][color=Red]Please let me know if you want the other seasons uploading[/color][/font]  ;) [/b] ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02fdbb51337f292a5a696f3ac809dc2c89aa7f7c","amp;dn":"The+Sopranos+Season+1+-+MP4+Format+-+Optimized+for+the+PSP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02fdbb51337f292a5a696f3ac809dc2c89aa7f7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,253,187,81,51,127,41,42,90,105,111,58,200,9,220,44,137,170,127,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
