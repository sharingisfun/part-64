Next, the drivers keep an eye on where they want to go -- and head to the infamous Eye of the Needle Challenge.\n\nFinally, the remaining drivers all pile into a bus and tackle the Reverse Figure Eight Challenge. All of the candidates think they know the technique, but learning to use side mirrors may prove to be more difficult than it looks. \n\nOne driver graduates after showing an improvement and our experts continue to watch closely to determine who will be Canada's Worst Driver.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfc18fd7a7879548872014350c7a92acc31156a2","amp;dn":"Canada%5C%27s+Worst+Driver+S07E02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfc18fd7a7879548872014350c7a92acc31156a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,193,143,215,167,135,149,72,135,32,20,53,12,122,146,172,195,17,86,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
