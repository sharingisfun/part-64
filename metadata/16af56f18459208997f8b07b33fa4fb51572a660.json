But in October 2008, less than a decade after Fred Goodwin took over as chief executive, it came within hours of collapsing. RBS later posted the biggest loss in UK corporate history - 24 billion pounds - which damaged the bank's reputation for financial prudence and Scotland's image as a global financial centre. Using previously unbroadcast footage of the bank's top executives and interviews with bank insiders, this documentary tells the compelling story of a national catastrophe.\n\nSTBHR-HD TS source MPEG/MPA streams\n\nVCodec: XviD 2pass MPEG 720*400\nACodec: AC3 192Kbps\n\nEnjoy,\n\nPls help seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16af56f18459208997f8b07b33fa4fb51572a660","amp;dn":"BBC+RBS_+Inside+the+Bank+That+Ran+Out+of+Money+XviD+AC3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16af56f18459208997f8b07b33fa4fb51572a660","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,175,86,241,132,89,32,137,151,248,176,123,51,250,79,181,21,114,166,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
