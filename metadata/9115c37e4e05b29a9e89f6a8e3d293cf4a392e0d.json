This track was released August 2, 2011.\n\nJack's Mannequin is an American alternative-rock band formed in 2004, originally hailing from Orange County, California. The band began as a side project of Andrew McMahon, the frontman for Something Corporate, and is composed of guitarist Bobby Anderson, newest member (as of 10/29/2010) bassist Mikey &quot;The Kid&quot; Wagner, and drummer Jay McMillan.\n\n[...]\n\nOn March 21, 2011, Andrew McMahon sent an email to his fans announcing a summer tour with Guster and revealing the title of Jack's Mannequin's third studio album: &quot;In a perfect world we will be finished with Jack's third album, 'People and Things', by the end of this month.&quot;\nOn July 19, 2011, it was announced that People and Things would be released on October 4, 2011. The first single, My Racing Thoughts, will be released on August 2, 2011.\nAccording to AbsolutePunk.net, McMahon had this to say about the new album, &quot;I consider 'People and Things' a relationship record. My goal with many of the songs was to strip away the flowery language and sentiment attached to newer love and replace it with starker, less blinded language about more binding love. In the time following the last Jack's album the people in my world were moving in together, getting married, trying to find quote unquote 'real jobs' and reconciling new lives that looked a lot less like youth than some of us cared for. Marriage is a bit of a beast to tackle in a pop record but when I wrote 'My Racing Thoughts,' it became clear how powerful and loaded a subject this kind of love is and somewhere in that moment I began to lock into the broad concept for the writing sessions to come.&quot;\n\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack%27s_Mannequin","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9115c37e4e05b29a9e89f6a8e3d293cf4a392e0d","amp;dn":"Jack%5C%27s+Mannequin+-+My+Racing+Thoughts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9115c37e4e05b29a9e89f6a8e3d293cf4a392e0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,21,195,126,78,5,178,154,158,137,246,168,227,210,147,207,74,57,46,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
