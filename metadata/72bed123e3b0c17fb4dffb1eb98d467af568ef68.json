If you want other seasons in retail, I suggest you look for them on the net since I have posted them in the past. I am not going to re-upload them minus season 5 and season 6 (if I get a hold of that one). So please no requests for previous seasons in retail, since they are already on the net. I will be placing one disc per week, so it will take 6 weeks at least to get the full season online. Make sure that everyone gets to 100%, so get those lines open please :D\n\nGhost Whisperer Season 5 Disc 2 - RETAIL\n\nThe series follows the life of Melinda Gordon (Jennifer Love Hewitt), who has the ability to see and communicate with ghosts.
