The show features auctioneer Dan Dotson, as well as auction hunters Dave Hester, Darrell Sheets, Barry Weiss, and Jarrod Schulz. When rent is not paid on a storage locker for three months in California, the contents are sold by an auctioneer as a single lot of items. The show follows professional buyers who purchase the contents based only on a 5 minute inspection and what they can see only from the door when it is opened. The goal is to turn a profit on the merchandise.\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dbeaabf35f7afcd7fa351d3c2a60dd9ac80261c","amp;dn":"Storage.Wars.S02E07._.XviD-sHoTV.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dbeaabf35f7afcd7fa351d3c2a60dd9ac80261c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,190,170,191,53,247,175,205,127,163,81,211,194,166,13,217,172,128,38,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
