Swing, climb, and jump your way through massive ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgardensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of vibrant other-worldly plant-life in this truly organic platformer and grow each garden as you explore and guide your tiny yet agile &quot;Grimp&quot; toward the elusive &quot;Spectra&quot; which are hidden throughout each stage. Ride giant plants as they grow beneath you, then swing from them destroying Pollen Prowlers in an ever-increasing cacophony of pollen. Be fired from cannons, float in zero-G, warp to mirror worlds or simply be buffeted about by the wind while clinging desperately to a dangling leaf; each garden has a unique set of challenges, puzzles and enemies that will expand your mind!\n\nFeaturing a minimal original techno soundtrack and unique graphic style both of which were created in harmony with each-other by Indie multimedia artist ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBaiyonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, Eden will give you an experience like no other game on this planet, or the next.\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements: \n\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Windows XP/Vista/7\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ DirectX 9c\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 2 GHz dual (with SSE3 support)\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 512 MB RAM\n\n\n\nInstallation:\n\n\n\n1.
