Ghostbird picks up where her debut left off, highlighting Avis voice and globe-trotting influences. But for all its worldly context, Ghostbird still wears its heritage lightly, placing more focus on the breezy songs themselves than the singers dual citizenship. The arrangements follow suit; theyre detailed and gorgeous, but they rarely overwhelm the music theyre meant to support, even at their most ornate. Ghostbird is a summer album for adventurous folk fans, engaging on its first run-thru but packed with enough twists and turns to warrant repeated listens.\n\nReleased: Aug 23, 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Alternative \nQuality: Lossless\nCodec: FLAC\n\nTracks:\n\n 1.Swell Window \n 2.Anchor \n 3.31 Days \n 4.Milestone Moon \n 5.Siboh Kitak Nangis \n 6.The Book of Morris Johnson \n 7.Madness \n 8.Bag of Gold \n 9.Concrete Wall \n 10.Roll Your Head In the Sun \n 11.Stay In the Clouds","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6c104182c2761e8557bcd4a4e5056a79c046b19","amp;dn":"Zee+Avi+-+Ghostbird+%282011%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6c104182c2761e8557bcd4a4e5056a79c046b19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,193,4,24,44,39,97,232,85,123,205,74,78,80,86,167,156,4,107,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
