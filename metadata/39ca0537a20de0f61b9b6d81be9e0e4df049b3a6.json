He's being hunted and is on his last dying breathe. He is       \n    found by a humble farmhouse cook named Tu who, at the request of the     \n    dying Sifu, must return a very important Kung Fu Academy Tablet to       \n    the Sifu's daughter Moli in the imperial city. Tu made a simple          \n    promise that turns out to change his life forever.                       \n                                                                             \n    Never having been to the city, Tu already got off to a dangerous         \n    start. He finds the Kung Fu Academy but finds that it has already        \n    been taken over by a ruthless panda named Slash. The old master          \n    (Sifu) and his daughter has gone missing. But to keep to his promise,    \n    Tu has no choice but to stay in the Academy to wait for their return.    \n    He's bullied from day one for knowing no Kung Fu. But serving as a       \n    cook there, he picks up some Kung Fu as the days go by.                  \n                                                                             \n    At the imperial city he meets a mysterious girl (Moli) who identifies    \n    herself as Moyan to keep her own safety. Rabbit never knew that this     \n    girl is the one he's supposed to pass the tablet to. After many          \n    misunderstandings, they finally are able to connect - but not before     \n    the big bad villain Slash decides to kill Moli and Tu for intervening    \n    with his evil plan to take over the entire China.                        \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
