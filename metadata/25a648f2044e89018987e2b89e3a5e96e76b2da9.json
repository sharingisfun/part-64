(formerly General Motors Diesel) of London, Ontario. A total of 123 were constructed between May 1975 and December 1980. The major difference between the SD40-2W and a regular SD40-2 is the fitment of a wide-nose Canadian comfort cab, denoted by the W in the model name.\n\nThe Canadian comfort cab or wide cab is a broad-nosed cab design found on several diesel locomotive types. It occupies the entire width of the locomotive, and typically has an access door on the front.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25a648f2044e89018987e2b89e3a5e96e76b2da9","amp;dn":"RailWorks+-+Canadian+National+Wide+Nose","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25a648f2044e89018987e2b89e3a5e96e76b2da9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,166,72,242,4,78,137,1,137,135,226,184,158,58,94,150,231,107,45,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
