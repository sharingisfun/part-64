Recorded in New Orleans, this session features his regular road band, abetted by Mark &quot;Kaz&quot; Kazanoff and some top N.O. players like Buckwheat Zydeco bassist Lee Allen Zeno. Shorty penned seven of the 12 tunes aboard, and the mix on this album runs from Texas shuffles (&quot;Sugar Wugar,&quot; &quot;I'm Going Back to Houston&quot;), low down blues (&quot;I Wonder Who's Sleeping in My Bed,&quot; &quot;You're a Troublemaker,&quot; &quot;Me and You Last Night&quot;) to New Orleans rock &amp; roll (&quot;I Want to Report a Crime,&quot; &quot;Hard Time Woman,&quot; &quot;The Porkchop Song&quot; and the title track) and funk (&quot;Don't Mess with My Woman,&quot; &quot;Let's Get Close&quot;), plus a heartfelt tribute to Hendrix on an extended workout on &quot;Hey Joe.&quot; A wide and varied session that showcases the guitarist's wide-ranging chops and skills. ~ Cub Koda\n\n[img]http://blogs.houstonpress.com/rocks/guitar%20shorty.jpg[/img]\n\n[size=4][color=red][b]Tracklist[/b][/color]\n1.&quot;I Want to Report a Crime&quot; 4:06\n2.&quot;Roll over, Baby 4:48\n3.&quot;Sugar Wugar&quot; 4:46\n4.&quot;You're a Troublemaker&quot; 5:21\n5.&quot;Don't Mess With My Woman&quot; 4:36\n6.&quot;Me and You Last Night&quot;  3:20\n7.&quot;Let's Get Close&quot;  3:10\n8.&quot;I Wonder Who's Sleeping in My Bed&quot; 7:04\n9.&quot;The Porkchop Song  2:46\n10.&quot;I'm Going Back to Houston&quot; 4:16\n11.&quot;Hard Time Woman&quot; 4:14\n12.&quot;Hey Joe&quot; 7:15\n\nRecorded at Ultrasonic Studios, New Orleans, Louisiana in April and May, 1998\n\nPersonnel\nDavid Torkanowsky ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ piano, organ (hammond)\nErnest Youngblood, Jr. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ saxophone (tenor)\nGuitar Shorty ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ guitar, vocals\nMark &quot;Kaz&quot; Kazanoff ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ saxophone (baritone, tenor)\nKenneth Blevins, Shannon Powell, Danny Pucillo Quartet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ percussion, drums\nJamil Sharif, Gary Slechta ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ trumpets\nRick Trolsen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ trombone\nLee Allen Zeno ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ bass, \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb6e21a755b1339acb9435f3d9318a47c58c6741","amp;dn":"Guitar+Shorty+Roll+Over+Baby%28blues%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb6e21a755b1339acb9435f3d9318a47c58c6741","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,110,33,167,85,177,51,154,203,148,53,243,217,49,138,71,197,140,103,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
