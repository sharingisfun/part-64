I used to use &quot;Total Uninstall&quot; and it was\nsuperior at one time, but has fallen behind further and further with each \nrelease, there hasn't been any major updates in years. Ashampoo has surpassed it \nwith new features, improved speed, and overall quality. Ashampoo does a great\njob because of it's before/after snapshots. Unlike &quot;Total Uninstall&quot;, Ashampoo\nscans your entire computer... very similar to &quot;RegShot&quot;. Many software vendors\ndo a crappy job when it comes to installers... i.e. dBpoweramp. their installers\nare so shitty, they had to release a separate &quot;clean up&quot; tool, and even that\ndoes not completely clean your system.\n\n* &quot;YOUR UNINSTALLER!&quot; sucks! stay away from that crappy software. It does no\nbefore/after snapshots. It uses Windows' native uninstaller. A complete rip-off!\n\nWINRAR EXAMPLE\n==============\nRegistry Changes: http://bayimg.com/NaJBdAADi\n    File Changes: http://bayimg.com/NajBeAaDi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:814d534d87443974dbe091ed1dc92850b18bdf91","amp;dn":"Ashampoo+Uninstaller+4%3A+Portable+%26+Stealth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"814d534d87443974dbe091ed1dc92850b18bdf91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,77,83,77,135,68,57,116,219,224,145,237,29,201,40,80,177,139,223,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
