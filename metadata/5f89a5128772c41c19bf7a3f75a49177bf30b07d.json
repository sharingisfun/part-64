Soon after, a group of warriors led by a warlord systematically destroys Conan's village to obtain part of a mask in Corin's possession. Left to die with his son, who is holding the vat of molten metal placed above him, Corin sacrifices himself so Conan can live.\n \nHaving ventured into an unforgiving world, hunting down the warlord for years, a now-adult Conan finally gets a lead when he learns Lucius, one of the men who ransacked Conan's village and whose nose he'd chopped off, became a warden. Allowing himself to be imprisoned, Conan confronts Lucius, learning that the warlord is known as Khalar Zym before forcing him to swallow the keys to every prisoner's shackles so Lucius would be slaughtered by them.\n \nOn his path of revenge, Conan chances upon Tamara, a beautiful novice nun and a descendant of the bloodline of the necromancers who first created the mask. Zym needs her blood to restore the mask so he can use its power to revive his wife. Learning of this from Remo, Khalar Zym's henchman, Conan brings Tamara along with him to use her as bait. Along the way he falls for her and, after she's kidnapepd by Marique, Khalar Zym's witch daughter, he fights through Khalar Zym's followers, destroys the mask and ends by accompanying Tamara to her city before returning to his burned-down village.\n\n(extracted from wikipedia)\n\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE FILES 2011\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f89a5128772c41c19bf7a3f75a49177bf30b07d","amp;dn":"Conan.the.Barbarian.CAM.2011+RMVB+GLOBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f89a5128772c41c19bf7a3f75a49177bf30b07d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,137,165,18,135,114,196,28,25,191,122,63,117,164,145,119,191,48,176,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
