To ferret out the problem, he sends a four-man crew on         \n    Flight 412. Shortly into the test, the jet picks up three blips on       \n    radar, and subsequently, two fighters scramble and mysteriously          \n    disappear. At this point, Flight 412 is monitored and forced to land     \n    by Digger Control, a top-level, military intelligence group that         \n    debunks UFO information. The intrepid colonel, kept in the dark about    \n    his crew, decides to investigate the matter himself.                     \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
