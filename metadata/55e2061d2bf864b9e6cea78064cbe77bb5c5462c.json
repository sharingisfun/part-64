The list was compiled by Hawass with the assistance of some of the world's leading Egyptologists. Each discovery has a theme centered around a part of everyday life in Ancient Egypt. For six of those discoveries, a certain emphasis is placed on how some of their themes have managed to influence modern life. The documentary concludes with a short segment on how the practice of mummification influenced modern surgery with both procedures sharing much of the same techniques.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt%27s_Ten_Greatest_Discoveries&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt%27s_Ten_Greatest_Discoveries&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nRELEASE DATE....: 17/08/2011\nTHEATRE DATE....: 2008\n\nGENRE...........: Documentary\nSOURCE .........: Egypt's Ten Greatest Discoveries 2008 Blu-ray 1080i AVC DD2.0-HDBT\nViDEO BiTRATE...: x264 r2044 subme11 @ 12.5mbps\nFRAME RATE......: 25 fps\nAUDiO ..........: English AC3 2.0 448kbps\nRUNTiME.........: 1:27:32(h:m:s)\nASPECT RATiO....: 1.78 : 1\nRESOLUTiON......: 1920 x 1080\nSUBTiTLES.......: Chinese\nChaperts........: Embedded\nFilE SiZE.......: 7.9G\nENCODER.........: HDlawrence","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55e2061d2bf864b9e6cea78064cbe77bb5c5462c","amp;dn":"Egypts.Ten.Greatest.Discoveries.2008.Bluray.1080p.AC3.x264-CHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55e2061d2bf864b9e6cea78064cbe77bb5c5462c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,226,6,29,43,248,100,185,230,206,167,128,100,203,231,123,181,197,70,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
