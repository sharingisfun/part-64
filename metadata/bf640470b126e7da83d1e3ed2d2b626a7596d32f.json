A thirty  year old  conspiracy. A  daughter's\n        journey to uncover the truth.\n\n        In  1978  Jimmy  Graham  went  to  Antarctica  with  Operation\n        Deepfreeze to train scientists in survival skills on the  ice.\n        He left in December of that year.\n\n        Three months later he  arrived back agitated and  paranoid. He\n        said that  he had  stumbled onto  an illegal  American nuclear\n        site and that  the CIA had  given him a  chemical lobotomy. He\n        descended into madness.\n\n        Unable to cope with  his frightening behaviour, his  wife fled\n        with their two children. Now, thirty years later, his daughter\n        Juliet will try to uncover the truth and reconnect with what's\n        left of the man she called her father.\n\n     \n                                           \n                   RIP NOTES                     \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                                    Enjoy!\n\n     \n                                           \n               GROUP INFORMATION                 \n       10 Years of the Force and still         \n                     going strong                      \n     \n\n        What we are looking for:\n\n        * gigabit euro sites for x264\n        * Fios x264 rippers or cappers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf640470b126e7da83d1e3ed2d2b626a7596d32f","amp;dn":"The.Snowman.2009.DVDRip.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf640470b126e7da83d1e3ed2d2b626a7596d32f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,100,4,112,177,38,231,218,131,209,227,237,45,43,98,106,117,150,211,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
