Built to 2-6-4 configuration, 155 examples were built from 1951 to 1956 and the type saw service across all regions except the Western Region.\n\nThough the basic design dates back to a Fowler design of 1927, the versatility of the 4MT ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ together with its ability to operate within a relatively restricted loading gauge ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ensured that these large tank locomotives outlived many other designs and continued in service until the end of British steam in the late 1960s. Today, 15 examples survive in preservation and continue to prove their versatility and durability.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a4a626cf54345fceea3b75d72d8494a4a5bc28b","amp;dn":"RailWorks+-+BR+Standard+4MT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a4a626cf54345fceea3b75d72d8494a4a5bc28b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,74,98,108,245,67,69,252,238,163,183,93,114,216,73,74,74,91,194,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
