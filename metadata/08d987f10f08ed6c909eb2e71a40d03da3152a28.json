We have an xvid version also\nposted with lovely century gothic Irish green hard coded English subtitles \n\nOxen was the deserving winner of The Academy Award in 1991 for best picture \n(non USA, Foreign movie classification)\n\nThis is a movie about Greatness of the Irish spirit and its capacity to \nendure stupid cruelty as is sometimes the state of affairs in the world.\nRemember the potato famine in Ireland too?\n\nLatin: Nescit plebs jejuna timere \n&quot;a starving populace knows nothing of fear&quot;\n\nBTW We bought the DVD from ebay recently for this torrent posting\nand it came in a lovely DVD jacket and slip-case decorative box\nin presentation style. It was also quite reasonably priced \nand quickly shipped - please purchase a copy if you can afford to - \nits mainly Hollywood that has all the money they need, have been an abusive\nmonopoly in respect of pricing and availability of formats, language and\nsubtitles options and even in respect of their agenda to destroy the \nIrish spirit with third world multicultural nonsense being mainly what\nthey now spew out - expecting us to pay with overpriced older DVDs such as\nthe Sound of Music - even after they've raked in a billion with no concern\nfor our kids that are without the means to afford it in all too many cases in truth!\n\nBy the way, an important torrent to the community such as this, should be \nretainable at the option of thepiratebay in an anonymous account or abandoned\npostings account should it ever be deleted by the uploader - if it is deemed\nto be the right thing to do in a particular case of a torrent or batch\nof torrents even  - that way, a torrent with a seeds doesnt \njust diappear overnight as all have invested in making it happen here.\nSome have reasons for deleting a torrent from their portfolio without\nobjecting to it being retained elsewhere in the system here.\n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmoviesbyrizzo\n \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08d987f10f08ed6c909eb2e71a40d03da3152a28","amp;dn":"Oxen+%28Sweden+-1991%29+The+Ox+-Sven+Nykvist+-+moviesbyrizzo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08d987f10f08ed6c909eb2e71a40d03da3152a28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,217,135,241,15,8,237,108,144,158,178,231,26,64,208,61,163,21,42,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
