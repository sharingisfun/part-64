For this special\nevent two pianos took centre stage. One for Elton, and the other, for an artist who inspired\nElton as a young musician; singer songwriter Leon Russell.\n\nLeon has written classic songs such as This Masquerade and Delta Lady, as well as working\nwith legends of popular music like The Beach Boys, Marvin Gaye, Frank Sinatra and The\nRolling Stones. Russell and Elton first worked together and toured the US in the early 1970s,\nbut lost touch for many years. Then last November Elton, Leon, Bernie Taupin and producer\nT Bone Burnett started collaborating in an L.A. studio on a new album, The Union. Making the\nnew record, Elton told Mojo magazine in August, &quot;made me fall in love with a guy I fell in love\nwith years ago,all over again&quot;.\n\nAs well as looking back at his roots, Elton's looked ahead by bringing on board two exciting\nnew names, Plan B and Rumer to perform alongside him. The show was broadcast live on\nBBC Radio 2 at 20:00 and then shown on BBC Two on Saturday 30 October, together with\nan exclusive documentary about his music and life.\n\nAn inspiring and emotional demonstration of poignant songwriting performed at its best.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/75212165471616561924.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/75212165471616561924.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_John&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_John&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Russell&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Russell&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n01 - Burn Down The Mission\n02 - Levon\n03 - Tiny Dancer\n04 - Ballad of a Well Known Gun\n05 - I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues (featurng Plan B)\n06 - Delta Lady\n07 - A Song for You\n08 - Masqureade (featuring Rumer)\n09 - If It Wasn't For Bad\n10 - Eight Hundred Dollar Shoes\n11 - Hey Ahab\n12 - Gone to Shiloh\n13 - Jimmy Rodgers Dream\n14 - There's No Tomorrow\n15 - Monkey Suit\n16 - The Best of the Day\n17 - Dreams Come True\n18 - I Should Have Sent Roses\n19 - When Love Is Dying\n20 - Hearts Turned To Stone\n21 - Never Too Old To Hold Somebody\n22 - In The Hands Of Angels\n23 - Tightrope\n24 - Prince of Peace/ Out of the Woods\n25 - Roll In My Sweet Baby's Arms\n26 - Stranger In A Strange Land\n27 - Your Song\n28 - Take Me To The Pilot\n29 - Sad Songs Say So Much\n30 - The Bitch Is Back\n31 - Hey Ahab\n\n\n::General::\n\nFormat: MPEG-4\nFile Size: 679 MiB\nOverall Bit Rate: 1 443 Kbps\nDuration: 1h 5mn\nSample: NO\nSubtitles: NO\n\n::Video Info::\n\nContainer: avc\nVideo Codec Type: x264\nVideo bitrate Variable: 1 200 Kbps\nResolution: 720 X 400 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR): 16:9\nQuality Factor(QF): 0.167\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps\nSource: (oan).Thanks!!\n\n::Audio Info::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate Mode: Variable\nBitrate: 240 Kbps ((( Stereo )))\nMaximum Bitrate: 576 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count: 2 channels [Front: L R]\n\n;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17e56b4b7e32501860409c08a5138d3d363b5e46","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Electric+Proms+Elton+John+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17e56b4b7e32501860409c08a5138d3d363b5e46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,229,107,75,126,50,80,24,96,64,156,8,165,19,141,61,54,59,94,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
