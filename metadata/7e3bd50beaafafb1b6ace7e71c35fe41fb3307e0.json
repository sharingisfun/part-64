Dracula, for all the gothic connotations the name might call up, deals in a different kind of busy, involving darkness and something shadowy.  The end effect is ultimately liberating, letting Nurses explore something more than the late-2000s indie cul-de-sac theyd found themselves in previously. \n\nReleased: Sept 19, 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie\nQuality: Lossless\nCodec: FLAC\n\nTracks: \n\n 1.
