It is a perfect\nreplacement for RegEdit and RegEdt32 which shipped with\nWindows.\n\nIn addition to all the standard features, Registry Workshop adds\na variety of powerful features that allow you to work faster and\nmore efficiently with registry related tasks.\n\nWith Registry Workshop, registry editing becomes more safe than\never before. All changes except changing key permissions can be\nsafely reversed (even registry replacing and importing), using\nmultiple levels of Undo. You don't need to worry about making\nmistakes when editing registry.\n\nWhether you are an advanced user who needs to edit and modify\nyour registry to remove trojan, virus, and spyware entries, a\nsystem administrator who needs a safer, more efficient tool to\nmaintain your company's PCs, or a software developer who needs\nto quickly manipulate registry keys and values during system\ndevelopment, Registry Workshop has the tools that you need.\n\niNSTALL NOTES\n\n1. Install Registry Workshop 4.5.0.\n2. Use this keygen to make a valid serial for your name.\n3. Have fun ;)\n\nABOUT GROUP\n\nThe FiGHTiNG FOR FUN team is proud to announce that we are\nthe first French web group still alive with more than 11.000\nreleases now.\nBorn in april 2002, we are the coolest team of the Scene and\nwe always fight for more knowledge and fun. Thanks for using\nour products, and see you for our 15.000th release :)\n\nOur greetings go to all people we know and who support us.\n\nFFF is proud to be a web group and to release nice products\nfor all.\n\nFFF is powered by the B.M.E (Bonobos Monkey Engine).\n\nIf you want to join in, find in meditation the way to us and\nask for a trial membership.\n\nFFF will not be responsible for and does NOT support warez\ndistribution of this release. It is forbidden to include\none of our releases in a warez distribution.\nGroups or individuals will be exposed for this!\n\nAs decided by FFF council\n\nSpecial note:\n\nOn some antivirus scans, FFF releases packages can reveal\n&quot;Type_Win32&quot; or &quot;Trojan_Type&quot; virus...\nDon't be stupid! It is not a virus nor anything else like\nthat. It is just some packers/cryptors which have the\nsame binary signature.\n\nHowever, some crackhosts can modify or add malicious\nthings on FFF releases (like &quot;crack.exe&quot;), so please,\nTAKE CARE.\n\nRemember:\nWe are cool but we don't need newbies or pretentious people.\n\nGREETiNGS\n\n* CORE * SSG * TMG * DI * RES *\n* RAiD * ECLiPSE * XFORCE * ECZ *\n* PC * ARTeam *  ACME * VDOWN *\n\nkorma\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55770286d559d31cc975da444da3b3df3a6850ce","amp;dn":"Registry.Workshop.4.5.0.Incl.KEYGEN-FFF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55770286d559d31cc975da444da3b3df3a6850ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,119,2,134,213,89,211,28,201,117,218,68,77,163,179,223,58,104,80,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
