It is based on the difficult time in the early to mid 70's when White British people struggled in their acceptance to the mass immigration of the Black community. They live next door to each other, the women get on and the men don't. The men also work together the White male character is portrayed as being quite working class and lesser educated, and continually calls his counterpart a &quot;nig nog&quot; and Sambo. Whilst the Black Male character is scripted as being more refined and well read; he is also very capable of racism though; he refers to his opposite as a &quot;honky&quot; or &quot;snowflake&quot;.\n\nWhilst being very popular during the early to mid 70's it did make rise to a great deal of criticism due to it's complete disregard to social cohesion and acceptance, if you were to study the episodes you do see racism on both parts. This boxset includes all 7 series which ran from 1972-1976, it did create similar controversy as did &quot;till death do us part&quot; due to the (in some cases) harsh racist comments and actions.\n\nThis will be something you either love and find hillarious or you hate and would find offensive. If it was to be aired on television these days it would have a continuity announcement warning of the likelihood to offence that may be caused.\n\nI would recommend that you ask someone who knows you well and that remembers it as to whether you would enjoy this. \n\nThe DVD releases of Love Thy Neighbour are somewhat muddled. Series 1-3 were originally released by Pegasus Entertainment, and Series 4-8 were released by FremantleMedia. movie has also been released by FremantleMedia. \n\n \n\n****************************************************************\n\nEPISODES\n1.Reggie Broadcast 2 January 1975)\n2.Jacko's Wedding (Broadcast: 9 January 1975\n3.Duel At Dawn Broadcast 16 January 1975\n4.The Darts' Final (Broadcast 23 January 1975\n5.Royal Blood Broadcast 30 January 1975\n6.Club Concert Broadcast 6 February 1975\n7.The Nannies Broadcast 13 February 1975","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:807c4cd2dd50bdca5592fcd99dd9ef943fa166c6","amp;dn":"Love+Thy+Neighbour+classic+Collection+Boxset%5BSeries+six%5DThe_Stig","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"807c4cd2dd50bdca5592fcd99dd9ef943fa166c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,124,76,210,221,80,189,202,85,146,252,217,157,217,239,148,63,161,102,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
