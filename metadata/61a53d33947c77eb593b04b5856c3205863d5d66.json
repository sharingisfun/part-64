But George has fallen in love with Molly Waddington. And Mrs Waddington prefers the idea of an aristocrat to the reality of George, whom she suspects is half-witted.\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s America during Prohibition and shy young George Finch is setting out as an artist ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ without the encumbrance of a shred of talent. George falls in love with Molly, whose imperious stepmother Mrs Waddington insists heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not the man to marry the stepdaughter of one of New YorkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most fashionable hostesses. Poor George ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ he doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t seem to stand a chance.\n\nHow George eventually triumphs over the bossy Mrs Waddington makes for a dizzying plot featuring some of WodehouseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most appealing minor characters ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Mullett the butler and his light-fingered girlfriend Fanny, J. Hamilton Beamish, author of the dynamic Beamish Booklets, Officer Garroway the poetic policeman, and Sigsbee H. Waddington, the hen-pecked husband who longs for the wide open spaces of the West.\n\nRead By: Jonathan Cecil (The best Wodehouse reader around!)\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61a53d33947c77eb593b04b5856c3205863d5d66","amp;dn":"The+Small+Bachelor+-+P.G.+Wodehouse+++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61a53d33947c77eb593b04b5856c3205863d5d66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,165,61,51,148,124,119,235,89,59,4,181,133,108,50,5,134,61,93,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
