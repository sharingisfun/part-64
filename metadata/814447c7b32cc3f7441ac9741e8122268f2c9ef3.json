Uses range from announcements at a party to pranking your friends. AirSpeak is simple to use, just 3 steps: 1) touch and hold down on the mic until the &quot;ON AIR&quot; sign lights up 2) speak your message 3) release your finger and it will play (n.b. You will have an option to select the AirPlay device you want to send the sound byte to. If none is selected, it will just play back on your device's default output. If no AirPlay devices are detected, the AirPlay icon will NOT show up!)
