That version is available for download elsewhere. \n\nFor more information about the different editions of this film, I would suggest you read it\\\\\\'s Wikipedia page, as well as the source links at the bottom of the Wikipedia page. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Garrett_and_Billy_the_Kid&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Garrett_and_Billy_the_Kid&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFrom IMDb:\nIt\\\\\\'s 1881 in New Mexico, and the times they are a\\\\\\'changing. Pat Garrett, erstwhile traveling companion of the outlaw Billy the Kid has become a sheriff, tasked by cattle interests with ridding the territory of Billy. After Billy escapes, Pat assembles a posse and chases him through the territory, culminating in a final confrontation at Fort Sumner, but is unaware of the full scope of the cattle interests\\\\\\' plans for the New West.\n\nActors:\nKris Kristofferson, James Coburn, Richard Jaeckel, Katy Jurado, Chill Wills, Jason Robards, R.G. Armstrong, and Bob Dylan.\n\n\nEncoding and Specifications:\nVideo: 866x352  -  Anamorphic Widescreen - Color \n23.98 fps   1200Kbps   h.264\nAudio: 192 Kbps variable  48KHz  AAC  Mono (the source is mono)  English\nRuntime: 2:01:42 (122 mins)  --  Total Size: 1.26 GB\nChapters are built in.\n\nAlthough I have not tested all of these, this should play on AppleTV 1 &amp; 2, iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, and most other MP4 players.\n\n-- On the PS3 there is slight vertical stretching (it doesn\\\\\\'t display squishes anamorphic) and the chapters and subtitles do not work.
