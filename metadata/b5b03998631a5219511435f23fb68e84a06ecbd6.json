RUBINSTEIN\nINTRADA MAF 7113\n\nIntrada presents Observations, a recording of Symphony In The GlenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s historic concert at Griffith Observatory on October 4, 2009 to mark\nthe launch of the Observatory's Cosmic Conjunction. The main highlight of the CD is the premiere of Arthur B. Rubinstein's 20-minute &quot;Observations.&quot; In &quot;Observations,&quot; the composer seeks to touch on that sense of the infinite which exists within each of us; creating a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“time travelogueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in music, from the primitive mysticism of the Ancients to the symphonic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbig bangÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of the Moderns. The piece draws from both the composerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s childhood and adult experiences. Thus, &quot;Observations,&quot; while not strictly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œprogrammatic,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a reflection of the child-like wonder and awe we all feel when contemplating the boundless reaches of space. The piece appears twice on this CD -- once with the narration by Leonard Nimoy and a second time without. Also featured on this CD are works by Claudio Monteverdi, Jean-Phillipe Rameau, Henri Duparc, and Darius Milhaud.\n\nCosmic Conjunction was developed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œto present original, substantive, artful, and unexpected perspectives on the relationship between astronomy and the artsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and fell during the International Year of Astronomy, in recognition of the 400th anniversary of GalileoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s telescopic discoveries. The music spans the 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st centuries, and each work expresses the composerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interpretation of some aspect of the cosmosÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬mythical, poetic, theatrical and historical. Each embraces both the simplicities and complexities of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“musicalizingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ the cosmos, as well as the mystery and romance of the night sky.\n\nClaudio Monteverdi/Hoder\n01.
