Nathan West, as well as several of his elite Special Forces trainees on what appears, at first, to have been a routine training exercise during a hurricane in the jungles of Panama.

So base commander Col. Bill Styles calls in ex-Ranger Hardy, an old friend and a persuasive interrogator. Osborne disapproves of Hardy who is on leave from the D.E.A. after having come under suspicion of accepting bribes from local drug traffickers. She is also uneasy when she learns that Hardy once trained under West and hates him almost as passionately as his current recruits...&quot;\n\n=========================================================================\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264395/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264395/&lt;/a&gt;\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a51c7bdbda41e14be3dbb2ae86927b6ae777200","amp;dn":"Basic.2003+-+Arabic+Subs+Hardcoded","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a51c7bdbda41e14be3dbb2ae86927b6ae777200","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,81,199,189,189,164,30,20,190,61,187,42,232,105,39,182,174,119,114,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
