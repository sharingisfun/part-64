It's folk inasmuch as it's all acoustic, and there's a feel of the tradition about it, even though everything is from her own pen. The opener, &quot;Because You're Young,&quot; recalls the fragility of Lisa Germano, both in composition and execution, but from there it's a left turn into very different places, where tales of talking dogs, frozen sparrows, and islands seem faintly gothic. Even the album's lone instrumental &quot;Meanwhile...&quot; brings to mind other things, in this case J.S. Bach. It's all very disquieting, the product of what can only be called a unique talent with a singular world vision. It's perhaps a folk audience that will go for this, although it's all so left-field that it should also bring in those who simply love the weird and unusual. On first play it can seem a little off-putting for its very sparseness, but on repeated listenings its many charms unfold like a flower -- the multiple musical layers of &quot;Ballad of the Talking Dog,&quot; for example. Some albums are for the short term, but My Mother's Children is a disc for the long haul.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/07/13/mary-hampton[/url]/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:670800262753d62a31c2e8d7b749ef5291a7082c","amp;dn":"Mary+Hampton...My+Mother%5C%27s+Children%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"670800262753d62a31c2e8d7b749ef5291a7082c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,8,0,38,39,83,214,42,49,194,232,215,183,73,239,82,145,167,8,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
