So, desperate for a breakthrough, he contacts former DI Sarah Lund and asks her to have a look at the case, a decision that isn't popular with everybody. She, who was demoted after the Nanna Birk Larsen case in the first series and currently works as a passport controller in Gedser in southern Denmark, isn't interested at first, but once she starts looking into the case she becomes just as engrossed as in the last case.\n\n It turns out that the lawyer had learned about a killing of civilians in Afghanistan, involving Danish soldiers, and someone killed her to stop her revealing something that mustn't be revealed. The tracks soon lead Lund into the corridors of power, and the truth turns out to be much more macabre than anyone could imagine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:148296000bd8a4e2610b9f0e92fe974d7be04a78","amp;dn":"Forbrydelsen+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"148296000bd8a4e2610b9f0e92fe974d7be04a78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,130,150,0,11,216,164,226,97,11,159,14,146,254,151,77,123,224,74,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
