ScreenSteps helps you answer questions by automatically creating image-based documents as you capture screenshots.\n\nUsing the integrated authoring tools you can quickly annotate images and add text. When you are finished you can export to HTML, PDF, Word (DOCX)*, WordPress, TypePad, Bloger, Movable Type, MindTouch*, Confluence*, Googles Sites*, Joomla or ScreenSteps Live.\n\nWhat's New\nVersion 2.9.0:\n\n* Support for bullet and number lists in descriptions and instructions.\n\n* PDF export now lets you select from a wide range of fonts as well as\n  specify different fonts for lesson and step titles as well as body text.\n\n* PDF documents now support all character sets supported within\n  ScreenSteps.\n\n* PDF templates now support borders around images.\n\n* Google Sites now supports encrypted connections.\n\n* You can now import multiple lessons at a time from ScreenSteps Live.\n\n* Key bindings on OS X now match standard platform key bindings.\n\n* New Code Block formatting option for styling programming code.\n\n* ScreenSteps can now automatically check for updates at launch if\n  preference is set.\n\nChanges:\n\n* ScreenSteps no longer creates duplicate lessons when importing a\n  manual from ScreenSteps Live.\n\n* ScreenSteps can automatically submit error reports now.

These\n  options open up too much room for error. You now must delete the link\n  between the manual and ScreenSteps Live using the Web pane of the\n  manual property inspector if you want to create a new manual or replace\n  an existing one.\n\n* Importing documents from ScreenSteps Live now updates existing\n  lesson rather than creating duplicates.\n\n* Added an extra line after the image in the Confluence template.\n\n* Updated DOCX Neutral template to include ListBullet and ListNumber\n  styles.\n\n* Blog/Wiki/SS Live dialogs now use large progress bars.\n\n* When generating tooltips for fields ScreenSteps no longer resolves\n  links to lessons that are outside of the current manual.\n\n* SQL Server is now passed all created_on/modified_on/posted_on dates\n  in YYYYMMDD format.

This would\n  cause errors in Word output.\n* Fixed issue with multiple authors being logged in when using a \n  ScreenSteps Workgroup floating license and logging in as another\n  author.\n* Dragging text within document fields now works.\n* Zendesk images would sometimes appear out of order when updating a\n  post.\n* When syncing step media filenames to step titles a &quot;.&quot; could end up at\n  the end of the filename.\n* Syncing image names to step titles when the document was not loaded \n would cause an error.\n* Entering a value &gt; 32767 for height or width when resizing an image would generate an error.\n\n* Copying and pasting links with URL links now preserves the links.\n\n* When downloading changes from a chapter on Screenteps Live,\n\n* ScreenSteps was not accurately detecting when a chapter no longer\n  existed on the ScreenSteps Live server.\n\n* Fixed issues in PAC support file included with ScreenSteps.
