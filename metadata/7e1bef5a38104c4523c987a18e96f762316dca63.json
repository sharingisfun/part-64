Ichigo Kurosaki's family is targeted by the Unforgiven, who are led by Shuren, and Ichigo's younger sister Yuzu Kurosaki is abducted. An Unforgiven named KokutÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ saves Karin Kurosaki from being abducted as well, and convinces Ichigo to accompany him and the Soul Reapers to Hell to save her. On the journey to Hell, Ichigo's Hollow mask begins to spontaneously manifest and KokutÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ warns him to avoid using it lest he lose control and hollowfy entirely. Ichigo, Rukia, Renji, Ishida, and KokutÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ battle Shuren and the other Unforgiven, and it becomes apparent that Shuren plans to use Ichigo's hollow powers to escape Hell. After Shuren and the other Unforgiven are defeated, KokutÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ betrays Ichigo and reveals he was the true leader of the Unforgiven and the one behind Yuzu's kidnapping. KokutÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ kills Yuzu and an enraged Ichigo hollowfies, blasting KokutÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ with his Cero, destroying most of the chains binding KokutÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ to Hell and burning through the gates of Hell. Renji breaks Ichigo's Hollow mask and grabs Yuzu's corpse while they are extracted by Soul Society, but Rukia, Renji, and Ishida are captured. When Yuzu spontaneously revives, Ichigo, despite being forbidden to do so by Soul Society, returns to Hell to rescue his friends and confronts KokutÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½, who killed Renji and Ishida and was torturing Rukia. Resisting hollowfication, Ichigo undergoes a transformation after being given power by the Hell guardians, becoming covered in bones, and defeats KokutÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½, bringing his friends back to life and escaping Hell as the gates repair themselves and vanish.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e1bef5a38104c4523c987a18e96f762316dca63","amp;dn":"Hatsuyuki-Tsuki+Bleach+The+Movie+4+The+Hell+Verse+HD+720p+Englis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e1bef5a38104c4523c987a18e96f762316dca63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,27,239,90,56,16,76,69,35,201,135,161,142,150,247,98,49,109,202,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
