In the last two minutes of any period, a team is allowed only one foul before the penalty, even if it hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t used up its allotment.\n- The following language was added to the Zone Defense Rule: &quot;After the offensive team has advanced the ball to its front court, a defensive player may not station himself in the key area longer than three seconds if it is apparent he is making no effort to play an opponent. The three second count starts when the offensive team is in clear control in the front court.&quot;\n\n\n\n!!!!AFTER DOWNLOAD, PLEASE SEED!!!!
