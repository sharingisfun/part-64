We strongly recommend that all users upgrade to this version.\n\nWhat's New:\n\nCorrected a problem that could cause recent Carbon applications such as BBEdit 10 and Filemaker Pro 11 to crash on Lion.\nFixed problems with some Default Folder X windows not appearing in applications when they're running in full screen mode.\n\nThe installation dialog for Default Folder X's helper application now comes up in front so Default Folder X isn't waiting quietly for a password that you don't know you need to enter.\nKnown issues with Lion (yes, we're working on these):\n\nYou will be asked for your admin password the first time you turn on Default Folder X.\n\nThere are currently some issues with Lion's window handling, so Default Folder X cannot be run with its icon in the Dock. The &quot;Put Default Folder X's icon and menus in the Dock&quot; option will be automatically turned off in your preferences when you run Default Folder X under Lion.\n\nDefault Folder X doesn't work in Preview, TextEdit, or in Safari when uploading files or attaching files to email messages.\nContextual menus do not work in some file dialogs.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nMac Intel OS 10.5+, Lion ready\n\n---&gt; PLEASE SEED &lt;---\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:325a99cf1680b535558489f45f171a7102ddf4ed","amp;dn":"Default+Folder+X+v.+4.4.3+%2B+Core+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"325a99cf1680b535558489f45f171a7102ddf4ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,90,153,207,22,128,181,53,85,132,137,244,95,23,26,113,2,221,244,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
