A fugitive alchemist with mysterious abilities leads the Elric brothers to a distant valley of slums inhabited by the Milos, a proud people struggling against bureaucratic exploitation. Ed and Al quickly find themselves in the middle of a rising rebellion, as the exiled Milos lash out against their oppressors. At the heart of the conflict is Julia, a young alchemist befriended by Alphonse. She'll stop at nothing to restore the Milos to their former glory - even if that means harnessing the awful power of the mythical Philosopher's Stone.\n\nGenre: Action and Adventure, Fantasy, Foreign\n\nDirector: Kazuya Murata\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nVideo: Xvid 848x480 23.98fps\n\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 320kbps\n___________________________________________________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3380378088a53f101985c21d9c883dab2f2051a","amp;dn":"Fullmetal+Alchemist%3A+The+Sacred+Star+of+Milos.+Official+Movie+Tr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3380378088a53f101985c21d9c883dab2f2051a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,56,3,120,8,138,83,241,1,152,92,33,217,200,131,218,178,242,5,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
