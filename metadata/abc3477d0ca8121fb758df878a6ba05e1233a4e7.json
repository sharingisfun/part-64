HALF-LIFE sends a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Valve's debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named &quot;Best PC Game Ever&quot; by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide. NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people people he cares about are counting\n on him. The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by SourceÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Valve's new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:\n\n* Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial &quot;muscles,&quot; human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence. \n\n * Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy. \n\n * Graphics: Source's shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy StoryÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® and Monster's, Inc.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game. \n\n * AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand\n\n.::: Watch Trailer On You Tube :::.\n\n\nHalf-Life 2 Tech Info:-\n\nPublisher:VU Games\n Developer:Valve Software\n Genre:Sci-Fi First-Person Shooter\n Release Date:Nov 16, 2004 (US)(more) \n ESRB:MATURE\n ESRB Descriptors:Blood, Intense Violence\n\nGame Information:-\n\nOnline Modes:Team Oriented\n Number of Players:1 Player\n\nOperating System:-\n\nWindows 98/2000/ME/XP\n\nMinimum System Requirements:-\n\nSystem:1.2 Ghz processor or equivalent\n RAM:256 MB\n Video Memory:32 MB\n Other:DirectX 7 compatible graphics card\n\nRecommended System Requirements:-\n\nSystem:2.4 Ghz processor or equivalent\n RAM:512 MB\n Other:DirectX 9 enabled graphics card\n\nInstructions:-\n\n(1) Run Setup.bat\n\n (2) Run desktop shortcuts when installation is completed.\n\n (3) Enjoy The Action Thriller !!!\n\n (4) If There Is A Problem In Extraction Rename And Extract.\n\n[img]http://ui31.gamefaqs.com/1502/gfs_53389_1_2.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://ui15.gamefaqs.com/206/gfs_51838_2_3.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://ui24.gamefaqs.com/183/gfs_53389_2_4.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://ui05.gamefaqs.com/1988/gfs_53389_2_27.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://ui03.gamefaqs.com/866/gfs_53389_2_103.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://ui32.gamefaqs.com/1343/gfs_53389_2_100.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abc3477d0ca8121fb758df878a6ba05e1233a4e7","amp;dn":"%5BPC+GAME%5D+Half+Life+2+%28Adventure+%2B+First+Person+Shooter%29+%5B+Team+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abc3477d0ca8121fb758df878a6ba05e1233a4e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,195,71,125,12,168,18,31,183,88,223,135,138,107,160,94,18,51,164,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
