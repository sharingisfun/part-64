They thrive on creating a positive atmosphere that encourages their audience to be themselves &amp; let loose.\n\t\nIshi formed in Dallas, Tx as a duo with JT Mudd &amp; Brad Dale at the end of 2006. Their sound derived from their vision to unify the instrumentation of Folk music with the endless soundscapes of electronic production. They started the recording process early 2007 with the intent to take their listeners on a uplifting journey exploring new sounds &amp; resolving back to their forefather &quot;Folk&quot; which inspired it all. Ishi released their debut record &quot;Through The Trees&quot; May, 2010 &amp; received two awards in the 2010 Dallas Observer Music Awards for &quot;Best New Act&quot; &amp; &quot;Best Electronic/Dance Band&quot;. This year the band has been nominated again for &quot;Best Electronic/Dance band&quot; &amp; will soon be determined on 10/18/11.\n\nIn May of 2011 the time had arrived to make changes to the roster by adding guitarist Rocky Ottely &amp; in June Becky Middleton joined the tribe as Female vocalist. James Mudd started playing in the Spring of '09 &amp; still remains on drums &amp; programming.
