In confidence trick slang, this famous swindle is referred to as a short-con because it is quick and easy to pull off.\n\nThe game requires three shells (thimbles, walnut shells, bottle caps, plastic cups, and even match boxes have been used), and a small, soft round ball, about the size of a pea, and often referred to as such. It can be played on almost any flat surface, but on the streets it is often seen played on a mat lying on the ground, or on a cardboard box. The person perpetrating the swindle (called the thimblerigger, operator, or shell man) begins the game by placing the pea under one of the shells, then quickly shuffles the shells around.\n\nOnce done shuffling, the operator takes bets from his audience on the location of the pea. The audience is told that if a player bets and guesses correctly, the player will win back double his bet (that is, he will double his money); otherwise he loses his money. However, in the hands of a skilled operator, it is not possible for the game to be won, unless the operator wants the player to win or if the player is allowed to touch the shells, in which case the player has a chance. The player must turn over any two shells saying that the pea is under neither of these. Since the pea is usually palmed, it is not under any of the shells and the mark has no choice but to pay up. This can only be done once.\n\nWhen an individual not familiar with the shell game encounters a game on the streets, it appears that bets are being placed by numerous players, when in reality, the people around the game are shills who are all part of the confidence trick.\n\nThe apparent players actually serve various roles in the swindle: they act as lookouts for the police; they also serve as \\\\\\&quot;muscle\\\\\\&quot; to intimidate marks who become unruly and some are shills, whose job is to pretend to play the game, and entice the mark into betting. Once a mark enters the circle of apparent players and faces the operator, the gang surrounds them to discourage an easy exit and to keep other pedestrians from entering and disrupting the confidence trick gang\\\\\\'s action on the main mark.\n\nThe job of crowding around also protects the operator from any incriminating photographs being taken of the act. The operator and the shills will try to get the mark into a heightened state of anger or greed. Once this is accomplished, one shill will pretend to disclose a winning strategy to the mark. It is all a ruse to get the mark to place a large bet.\n\nThe operator\\\\\\'s trick is sleight of hand. A skilled operator can remove a pea from under any shell (or shells) and place it (or not) under any shell (or shells) undetected by a mark. So it is never of any benefit for the mark to watch the movement of either the shells or the operator\\\\\\'s hands.\n\nWhen the operator has finished moving the shells around, he asks the mark if they wish to bet on the play. If a mark agrees, they have to place their money down before they can point to a shell. Using sleight of hand, the pea is revealed to be under a different shell than chosen.\n\nIf no mark wants to play, one of the shills may start the play in order to animate the mark. The shill will either lift a shell which is \\\\\\&quot;obviously\\\\\\&quot; wrong and will lose his money, or he lifts the \\\\\\&quot;obvious\\\\\\&quot; shell and wins. Or he may pretend that he has discovered some trick, and either \\\\\\&quot;succeed\\\\\\&quot; or clumsily fail.\n\nThe game should not be mistaken for an honest game. It is not possible for a mark to win, even if they know how the trick is worked, or even if they \\\\\\&quot;accidentally\\\\\\&quot; pick the shell that actually has the pea under it. Through very skilled sleight of hand, the operator can easily hide the pea, without the mark\\\\\\'s seeing him do so.\n\nAny player who is suspected of understanding the trick, or does not place a bet and just wants to watch, will be quickly edged away from the table by the shills or the muscle. The shell game set-up and lay-out is quick and simple, so that in the event of trouble, or if they are signaled that authorities are approaching, they can remove all traces of the game in seconds.\n\n\n\nEn fingerfÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rdig person i ligan sitter pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ huk och fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rpassar en papperskula mellan tre tÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ndsticksaskar.  Den som satsat 500 kronor och gissar rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤tt (under vilken ask kulan slutligen ligger) vinner det dubbla. Men det ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r ingen som vinner, endast medbrottslingarna som stÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥r i en ring runtom och lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥tsas vara turister. PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ detta sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤tt fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ngas dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ och dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ en inte ont anande fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rbipasserande pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ kroken och tror sig veta under vilken av askarna kulan ligger och satsar 500 kronor eller 50 euro, garanterat fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rlorade pengar. Den fingerfÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rdige spelaren smusslar omÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rkligt undan kulan sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ att det ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r tomt under asken nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r han vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nder pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ den.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4265053af492de2098cf6dc06de412526a8796b0","amp;dn":"Stockholm%2C+Shell+Game+street+scam%2C+video+clips","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4265053af492de2098cf6dc06de412526a8796b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,101,5,58,244,146,222,32,152,207,109,192,109,228,18,82,106,135,150,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
