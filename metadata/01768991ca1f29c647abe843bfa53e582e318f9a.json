Running from a maniac (The Tin Man) bent on killing them, they flee deep into the woods and seek refuge in a house. They soon realize the killer has purposely lured them to this house and that they are now trapped. As they huddle around an old fireplace, a tin can falls through the chimney. Scrawled on its side is a message from the killer, establishing his House Rules. The rules call for their deaths unless they kill at least one of the four. They have less than 12 hours to find a way to survive. At sunrise the game is over and everyone dies if the killer's demands aren't met. What they quickly learn is that the only way out... is in. But going further into this house--where unknown challenges await them--is equally deadly. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0837796/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0837796/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01768991ca1f29c647abe843bfa53e582e318f9a","amp;dn":"House+%282009%29+%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01768991ca1f29c647abe843bfa53e582e318f9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,118,137,145,202,31,41,198,71,171,232,67,191,165,62,88,46,49,143,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
