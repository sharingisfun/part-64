Twenty-eight years later, the initial welcome by the human population has faded. The refugee camp where the aliens were located has deteriorated into a militarized ghetto called District 9, where they are confined and exploited in squalor. In 2010, the munitions corporation, Multi-National United, is contracted to forcibly evict the population with operative Wikus van der Merwe in charge. In this operation, Wikus is exposed to a strange alien chemical and must rely on the help of his only two new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Prawn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' friends.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e4601fd2054b0ea9c4f806894ba6d5920f3a878","amp;dn":"Distict+9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e4601fd2054b0ea9c4f806894ba6d5920f3a878","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,70,1,253,32,84,176,234,156,79,128,104,148,186,109,89,32,243,168,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
