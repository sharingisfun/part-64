After years of growing apart, Harold Lee (John Cho) and Kumar Patel (Kal Penn) have replaced each other with new friends and are preparing for their respective Yuletide celebrations. But when a mysterious package mistakenly arrives at Kumar's door on Christmas Eve, his attempt to redirect it to Harold's house ends with the &quot;high grade&quot; contents--and Harold's father-in-law's prize Christmas tree--going up in smoke. With his in-laws out of the house for the day, Harold decides to cover his tracks, rather than come clean. Reluctantly embarking on another ill-advised journey with Kumar through New York City, their search for the perfect replacement tree almost blows Christmas Eve sky high.\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nDirector: Todd Strauss-Schulson\n\nCast: John Cho, Kal Penn, Paula GarcÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s, Danneel Harris, Tom Lennon, Danny Trejo, Elias Koteas, Eddie Kaye Thomas, David Krumholtz, Patton Oswalt, Neil Patrick Harris\n\nWriters: Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nVideo: Xvid 1920x816 23.98fps\n\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 320kbps\n___________________________________________________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fc0a58a704a91e045bebe30ec6735f0066313ce","amp;dn":"A+Very+Harold+and+Kumar+3D+Christmas.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%5BHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fc0a58a704a91e045bebe30ec6735f0066313ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,192,165,138,112,74,145,224,69,190,190,48,236,103,53,240,6,99,19,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
