His cranky landlord tries to kick him out of his room as most of his neighbors and friends vacate the place, leaving Arnold more and more isolated.\n\nHis innocent girlfriend tries her best to lift his mood but in private Arnold's fantasies get more and more morbid. He plays around with a gun (in a pre Taxidriver way) and adds countless locks to his door. He suffers from hallucinations and starts to think he is a former SS member, hunted down by the police. Gradually we learn Arnold suffered a trauma at the beginning of WW2. But as this is a reworking of a short story by the Dutch mysantropic author Willem Frederik Hermans, the stories we get to hear about the war are unremarkable and painfully unheroic.\n\nAll this is dramatized in long shots making great use of Amsterdam as location and the actor's youthfulness. Jan de Bond's camera work is stunning and the strumming on a guitar and the moody organ that serve as soundtrack are very effective. In my opinion this is an important film and it exhibits a feel for film and story, combined with a very self assured style, seldomly seen before and after in Dutch cinema. ~worldcinema.com\n\nDirector:\nAdriaan Ditvoorst\n\nWriters:\nAdriaan Ditvoorst, Willem Frederik Hermans (novel)\n\nStars:\nKees van Eyck, Pamela Koevoets and Rudolf Lucieer\n\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 700 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 37mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 007 Kbps\nWriting application              : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library                  : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Custom\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 37mn\nBit rate                         : 889 Kbps\nWidth                            : 528 pixels\nHeight                           : 400 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.168\nStream size                      : 618 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 37mn\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 105 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 72.9 MiB (10%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 386 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97 \nEncoding settings                : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4725daabf0872e994d0532bf9ed827850298c401","amp;dn":"Paranoia+%281967%29+Adriaan+Ditvoorst+En-Pt+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4725daabf0872e994d0532bf9ed827850298c401","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,37,218,171,240,135,46,153,77,5,50,191,158,216,39,133,2,152,196,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
