Charlie (Woody Harrelson) and John (Wesley Snipes) are not just co-workers and close friends but also foster brothers. Because of this family connection, the reluctant John becomes involved in the more capricious Charlie's far-fetched scheme to rob the &quot;money train&quot; that collects the subway's daily grosses. Charlie needs the money for gambling debts, and robbing the train would have the added benefit of angering Charlie's and John's harsh, corrupt boss Captain Patterson (Robert Blake). Romantic interest is provided by a fellow police officer (Jennifer Lopez) who sparks rivalry between the brothers, but the film's main interest is in the violent events that surround the attempted heist, which naturally proves more complicated than planned. The film attempts to capitalize on the chemistry between Snipes and Harrelson, who had previously had a hit comedy with White Men Can't Jump (1992), but Joseph Ruben's unexceptional direction and a bland screenplay by Doug Richardson and David Loughery make the film less distinctive than its predecessor.\n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 50 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 1366\n\nFrame Height: 768\n\nFrame Rate: 30fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 160kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95728203ef52fe6e75b0404dc29249764d117994","amp;dn":"Money+Train%281995%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95728203ef52fe6e75b0404dc29249764d117994","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,114,130,3,239,82,254,110,117,176,64,77,194,146,73,118,77,17,121,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
