On the album, Marie Fredriksson gives her own, personal interpretation of the music she grew up with during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nFredriksson's comments on the album: These songs here have been my best friends during the important years of my life. When I took my old, scratched long playing records to listen them again, I noticed how great they are. Still great. I began sing songs by myself and I discovered that I longed to sing in Swedish again. The idea of making a record, where I could sing songs of old favourite like John Holm, Pugh Rogefeldt and Hoola Bandoola Band started to grow slowly. Everything had really been improvised a lot. Freedom. Especially when it concerns the song and the arrangement. It is not so polished anymore. This is what songs just need\n(wikipedia)\n\n- - -\n\nMarie Fredriksson - Min baste vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤n 2006\n(Solna EMI/Mary Jane)\n\n 1. Din bÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ste vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤n. \n 2. SommarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ng. \n 3.
