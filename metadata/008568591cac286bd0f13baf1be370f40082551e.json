Been working on this for a few days now. Playin wi colours n filters mainly and runing a 2 step encode. Started with imagines 480p and did a test run of it, while i waited for the 720p. I personaly had issues with the 720p file to start with. Mainly a small degree of corruption in the avi container and audio. I had to repair the avi container to encode the video correctly but had to revert to the audio track from the 480p.\n\nWork done:\n\nVideo: Did this in two stages. First, i used the youtube hd trailer linked above to help me tune in elements such as colours, contrast, hue, saturation, brightness, whitescale etc. I encoded this to lossless decompressed rgb in 720p. At this point i concidered doing the final encode in 720p but decided against it. I created a script that resised it down to 720 x 304 like all the others. Used a decent sharpner and my custom seesaw script with my fav blender. I then encoded this in x264 to retain as much detail as possible.\n\nAudio: Like i said, the one in the 720p was damaged. I could demux it but it wouldnt decompress to wav so i could work on it, due to corruption. So i took the one from there 480p, lowered the volume on that little intro to be less harsh, gave the high end a big lift and the bass a lift, ran over the final result with denoiser to remove the inevitable excess hiss from the high end lift.\n\nI think the end result on this is realy nice and av gota give props to imagine for such a challenging source that had loads of potential. I had alot of fun with this one \n\n[imgw]http://bitpic.bitboxes.co.uk/images/271FtsWzTu8.png[/imgw]\n\n[color=blue][b]Screenshots[/b][/color]\n\n[imgw]http://bitpic.bitboxes.co.uk/images/292UZy2ati1.jpeg[/imgw]\n\n[imgw]http://bitpic.bitboxes.co.uk/images/138lNbvw0Tn.jpeg[/imgw]\n\n[imgw]http://bitpic.bitboxes.co.uk/images/621l05bahAQ.jpeg[/imgw]\n\n[imgw]http://bitpic.bitboxes.co.uk/images/818FyrmqeC4.jpeg[/imgw]\n\n[imgw]http://bitpic.bitboxes.co.uk/images/835cwRWyuyT.jpeg[/imgw]\n\n[color=Darkblue][b]eNJOY[/b][/color]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:008568591cac286bd0f13baf1be370f40082551e","amp;dn":"Cowboys.And.Aliens.2011.TS.x264.AAC.DD.Kingdom.release","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"008568591cac286bd0f13baf1be370f40082551e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,133,104,89,28,172,40,107,208,241,59,175,27,227,112,244,0,130,85,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
