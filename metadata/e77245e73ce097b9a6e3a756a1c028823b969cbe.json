It was executive produced by Wes CravenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the only film of the Wishmaster series with his name attached.\n\nThe plot of Wishmaster concerns a djinn (evil genie), an omnipotent, supremely evil entity who is released from a jewel and seeks to capture the soul of the woman who discovered him, thereby opening a portal and freeing his fellow djinn to inhabit the earth. The film stars Andrew Divoff and Tammy Lauren, and features many actors from other popular horror movies such as Nightmare On Elm Street, Day of the Dead, and Candyman. Three sequels were made, featuring differing casts and crews: Wishmaster 2: Evil Never Dies, Wishmaster 3: Beyond the Gates of Hell, and Wishmaster 4: The Prophecy Fulfilled.\n\nScreenshots:-\n\n[img]http://Pictat.com/i/2011/8/16/301571682455.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://Pictat.com/i/2011/8/16/434653691863.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://Pictat.com/i/2011/8/16/153293913035.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://Pictat.com/i/2011/8/16/362914122864.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://Pictat.com/i/2011/8/16/27534newrough.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e77245e73ce097b9a6e3a756a1c028823b969cbe","amp;dn":"Wishmaster+Movie+1+DVD+Rip-Faraz%28IARG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e77245e73ce097b9a6e3a756a1c028823b969cbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,114,69,231,60,224,151,185,166,227,167,86,161,192,40,130,59,150,156,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
