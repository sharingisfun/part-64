Olsen John Gay\nProduced By: William S. Gilmore Gabriel Katzka Joseph E. Levine Harold Loeb\nMusic: Roy Budd\n\nThe movie provided the first motion picture account of the Sand Creek massacre, one of the most infamous incidents in the history of the American frontier, in which Colorado Territory militia under Colonel John M. Chivington massacred a defenseless village of Cheyenne and Arapaho on the Colorado Eastern Plains.\nAt the time of the actual historic massacre, the panel of the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War declared:\n\nQuote:\nAs to Colonel Chivington, your committee can hardly find fitting terms to describe his conduct. Wearing the uniform of the United States, which should be the emblem of justice and humanity; holding the important position of commander of a military district, and therefore having the honor of the government to that extent in his keeping, he deliberately planned and executed a foul and dastardly massacre which would have disgraced the verist savage among those who were the victims of his cruelty. Having full knowledge of their friendly character, having himself been instrumental to some extent in placing them in their position of fancied security, he took advantage of their in-apprehension and defenceless condition to gratify the worst passions that ever cursed the heart of man. Whatever influence this may have had upon Colonel Chivington, the truth is that he surprised and murdered, in cold blood, the unsuspecting men, women, and children on Sand creek, who had every reason to believe they were under the protection of the United States authorities.\n\nThe account of the massacre is included as part of a longer fictionalized story about the escape of two white survivors from an earlier massacre of U.S. Cavalry troops by Cheyenne, and names of the actual historical characters were changed.\n\n\n\n\nControversy\n\nLobbycard displayed in theaters\n\nReleased during the Vietnam War, shortly after public disclosure of the My Lai massacre, the film was controversial at the time not only for its subject matter, but also for its graphic depictions of violence. Nelson, who also appeared in the movie in a minor role, pushed the depiction of the violence to explicit levels, showing nudity during rape scenes, as well as realistic close-up shots of bullets ripping into flesh.\n\nBritish author and critic P.B. Hurst wrote:\n\nQuote:\nA good number of critics in 1970 believed that Soldier Blue had set a new mark in cinematic violence, as a result of its graphic scenes of Cheyenne women and children being slaughtered, and had thus lived up ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ or down ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to its U.S. poster boast that it was &quot;The Most Savage Film in History.&quot; A massive hit in Great Britain and much of the rest of the world, Soldier Blue was, in the words of its maverick director, Ralph Nelson, &quot;not a popular success&quot; in the United States. This probably had less to do with the picture's groundbreaking violence, and more to do with the fact that it was the U.S. Cavalry who were breaking new ground. For Nelson's portrayal of the boys in blue as blood crazed maniacs, who blow children's brains out and behead women, shattered for ever one of America's most enduring movie myths ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ that of the cavalry as good guys riding to the rescue ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and rendered Soldier Blue one of the most radical films in the history of American cinema. The film's failure in its homeland might also have had something to do with the perception in some quarters ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ prompted by production company publicity material ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ that it was a deliberate Vietnam allegory.\n\n\nCAST\nCresta Maribel Lee ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Candice Bergen\nHonus Gantz ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Peter Strauss\nIsaac Q.

Olsen (republished as Soldier Blue after the movie was released). It starred Candice Bergen, Peter Strauss and Donald Pleasence. The title song was performed by Buffy Sainte-Marie.\n\nIn September 1970, Dotson Rader of The New York Times, wrote that Soldier Blue &quot;must be numbered among the most significant, the most brutal and liberating, the most honest American films ever made&quot;.\n\n\nPLOT\nA young woman, Cresta Lee (Bergen), and young U.S. private Honus Gant (Strauss) are joined together by fate when they are the only two survivors after a cavalry group is massacred by the Cheyenne. Gant is much devoted to his country and duty; Lee, who has lived with the Cheyenne for two years, declares that in this conflict she sympathizes more with them. The two must now try to make it to Fort Reunion, the army base camp.\n\n\nENJOY ALL :=","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4eeebef56560a264946c4313bf39d4ac715db48","amp;dn":"Soldier+Blue+%281970%29+%5BBluRay+1080p-MultiLang-MultiSub%5D+Western+%5BT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4eeebef56560a264946c4313bf39d4ac715db48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,238,235,239,86,86,10,38,73,70,196,49,59,243,157,74,199,21,219,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
