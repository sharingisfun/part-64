WIOD was unique among almost all talk stations in America (the Loop, WLUP, Chicago was similar) in that the emphasis was on entertainment and not news/talk. While Phil was there, from spring 1994 through September of 1996, the lineup consisted of Rick and Suds in the morning, the legendary Neil Rogers, middays, Phil doing afternoons, Jeff DeForrest with sportsTalk 6-8 and Erin Sommers' Lovelines 8-midnight. Each year the station offered for sale Best Of c.d's to fans of WIOD wth proceeds going to benefit different charities in south Florida. It is one of those (Phil did three in all at WIOD) that we're making available on a track by track basis here, Phil Hendrie, Best of 1994.\n\nThis period reflects the beginning of Phil pulling all of the elements of his show together to create the legendary radio he's known for. It's to the WIOD and Phil Hendrie fans of Miami that we dedicate this work today. They got it before anybody.\n\nclick my name for 2011 phil and classic phil 1999-2006\n\nCOMING SOON:\nPhil Hendrie Best of 1998 - A Chilling Day For Talk Radio \nPhil Hendrie Best of 1997 - Still on the Air! \n\n-------------------------------------\n\nFuture of DUBSTEP         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6624204/Future_Of_Dubstep_2011_(SUPER_NEW__)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6624204/Future_Of_Dubstep_2011_(SUPER_NEW__)&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6780143/Future_Of_DUBstep_2012_(ELECTRONIC)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6780143/Future_Of_DUBstep_2012_(ELECTRONIC)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nVOLUME 31 - NEW\n\n3 gigs of pure music made by me \nFor more rap music , hip hop , electronic, over 5 genres\nover 3 gigs!\nultimate mixtape \nelectronic, and 80s music all in one\nu gotta get this\n        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6746589/Digital_Crack_Vol_31_-_Ultimate_Hip_Hop_-_Electro_MiXtape_&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6746589/Digital_Crack_Vol_31_-_Ultimate_Hip_Hop_-_Electro_MiXtape_&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\ncheck out my other unique cool torrents\namerican greed season 4\ncrank yankers season 3\njersey shore season 4\nphil hendrie show all years\nPerfect Photo Suite 6\nand over 40 gigs of music !\n        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/atndigcrk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/atndigcrk/&lt;/a&gt;\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55c40127753964546d6a726e5203be337e2bc6e9","amp;dn":"Phil+Hendrie+Show+-+Best+of+1994+WIOD+%28CLASSIC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55c40127753964546d6a726e5203be337e2bc6e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,196,1,39,117,57,100,84,109,106,114,110,82,3,190,51,126,43,198,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
