PhotoLinker complies with the recently released (9/2008; rev 2/2009) recommendations of the Metadata Working Group, ensuring proper handling of your photos' metadata.\n\nInteractive geotagging with live updates to proposed locations as geotagging critieria are changed. Photos can also be manually geotagged by pinpointing a location on a map, entering the coordinates manually, or tagging them to waypoints.\n\nPhotoLinker's track and waypoint browser handles years of data and millions of track points imported from your computer or downloaded directly from your GPS receiver. Tracks are automatically cataloged by date and displayed on an interactive map where the size and color can be adjusted.\n\nWhat's New\nVersion 2.2.9:\n\nAdded a preference that allows the altitude field to become directly user editable.\n\nBug Fixes\n\nFixed a crasher with the NMEA importer.\nAdded some small tweaks to the google reverse geocoder to prevent hangs when Waypoints now retain their size, shape and color after restart.\nOther small bug fixes.\n\nMore info: http://www.earlyinnovations.com/photolinker/\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nPPC / Intel, Mac OS X 10.5 or later\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca60a4492cbd8149f7384ea8980fc9649858047e","amp;dn":"PhotoLinker+2.2.9+%2B+Core+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca60a4492cbd8149f7384ea8980fc9649858047e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,96,164,73,44,189,129,73,247,56,78,168,152,15,201,100,152,88,4,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
