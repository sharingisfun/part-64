Winds of Change is a unique collection of South African music and extracts from significant political speeches that charts the journey to freedom from the struggle days right through to eventual democracy.\n\nThrough folk songs, freedom songs, tribute songs and narrative, the special story of the nation of South Africa unfolds, revealing the massive role of music as a means of protest and survival. All songs chosen for this collection speak of the miraculous journey to democracy either with their words or by symbolising a specific era. This collection traces the incredible journey of a nation that defied all expectations; our Mzansi.\n\nWinds of Change is the musical discography of the South African story, touching on the horrors of apartheid, and later the unbanning of the ANC, and the beginning of a free society.\n\nHeartfelt songs such as Amampondo's State of Emergency, Johnny Clegg's unforgettably impressive Asimbonanga, Stimela's Whispers in the Deep, Johannes Kerkorrel's Halala Afrika, Hugh Masekela's Bring him back home, Skeem's Waar Was Jy and Sibongile Khumalo's Sabela are all included on this iconic album.\n\nBetween the songs you'll hear excerpts of various iconic speeches such as Mandela's Rivonia Trial speech, PW Botha's Total Onslaught speech, FW de Klerk's unbanning speech and Mandela's inauguration speech.\n\nThis album highlights how crazy things were in SA and how far we have come; to see South Africans - regardless of race - singing Nkosi Sikheli I'Africa or Shosholoza at sport events is still a goosebump affair.\n \n\n   Track listing\n\n\n\n 1 Nkosi Sikelel' Iafrika     \n 2 Winds of Change   \n 3 Zono Zam    \n 4 Nobel Prize Award    \n 5 Zandile    \n 6 Rivonia Trial Speech    \n 7 Woza Anc    \n 8 Ag Pleez Deddy    \n 9 Kalamazoo  \n 10 Fight to the end    \n 11 Joyin Umkhonto Wesizwe    \n 12 Burnout    \n 13 Total Onslaught    \n 14 State Of Emergency \n 15 Paradise Road    \n 16 Awb Speech    \n 17 Slovo No Tambo    \n 18 Bayeza    \n 19 Tsoha/Vuka    \n 20 Asimbonanga   \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8b19dee4f55e19bd8c91adfbec12199434736c0","amp;dn":"The+Winds+of+Change+-+South+African+Struggle+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8b19dee4f55e19bd8c91adfbec12199434736c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,177,157,238,79,85,225,155,216,201,26,223,190,193,33,153,67,71,54,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
