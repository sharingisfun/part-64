To triangulate\nour sound, pick up signals from Kraftwerk, The B-52's and\nGoldfrapp. Or think of a half-remembered fever dream\nfeaturing Ferris Bueller and Grace Jones.\nAll bands are transient. The album 'Fatty Gets A Stylist'\nwas mostly written and recorded on a lap top over several\nmonths in the different locations we found ourselves in\nbetween Australia, South East Asia and our loft which is\nunfashionably located in West London.\nOur singer's name is Kate Miller-Heidke. Her name may\nsound familiar but her voice will not. Not even her own\nband recognised she was Fatty's singer because of the\nunusual use of her lower register. Keir Nuttall is a guy\nwho programs and produces.\nOther musicians include bass player Justin Meladl-Johnsen\n(Air, Beck, Nine Inch Nails) and drummer Pete McNeal\n(Cake). Mickey Petralia (Flight of the Conchords, Back,\nThe Eels) engineered and played percussion on much of the\nrecord.\n'Fatty Gets A Stylist', the album, was mixed by Cenzo\nTownsend, a modern hero of the art of mixing and\nresponsible for sculpting influences of ours such as\nFlorence and The Machine, Bloc Party and Editors. He is\nsuch a genius they gave him an O.B.E. Or was it a Brit\nAward? Same thing. We were lucky enough to persuade him\n(it did take some bribery) to mix our record.\nWe practice loose, Western Zen, drink martinis and enjoy\nnose-to-tail dining.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87d3a6040570da7a7f748b90f964581ce6b8566a","amp;dn":"Fatty+Gets+A+Stylist+-+Fatty+Gets+A+Stylist+%282011%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87d3a6040570da7a7f748b90f964581ce6b8566a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,211,166,4,5,112,218,122,127,116,139,144,249,100,88,28,230,184,86,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
