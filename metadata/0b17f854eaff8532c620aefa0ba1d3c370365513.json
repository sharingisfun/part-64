It is the third sequel in the Lethal Weapon series of films.\n\n\nPlot\n\nLorna Cole is pregnant with LAPD sergeant Martin Riggs' baby; they are not married, but both are thinking about it. Police sergeant Roger Murtaugh's daughter Rianne is also pregnant, and Riggs later learns from Lorna that Rianne has secretly married Lee Butters (Chris Rock), a young detective who works at the same precinct as Murtaugh and Riggs - secretly because Roger had made it clear that his daughter should not marry a police officer.\n\nRiggs, Murtaugh, and Butters - with some assistance from Leo Getz (Pesci), who is now a private detective - investigate a Chinese immigrant smuggling ring after they come across a vessel with a cargo hold of Chinese slave laborers; in the course of these events Murtaugh's boat is sunk. Murtaugh finds a dinghy alongside with a Chinese family whom he provides shelter for at his house, claiming to be &quot;freeing slaves.&quot;\n\nInformation about a crime boss named Benny Chan (Kim Chan), a.k.a. &quot;Uncle Benny,&quot; leads them to Chinatown, where they are introduced to a high-ranking Triad negotiator named Wah Sing Ku (Jet Li). Benny forces the three cops out of the restaurant without providing information on what his and the Triads' plans are. Outside, the cops encounter the captain of the ship and chase him and another suspect. The other suspect turns out to be a restaurant waiter and is freed. Ku later kills the captain for letting the cops know about their secret plans.\n\n\nDirected by \tRichard Donner\nProduced by \tRichard Donner\nJoel Silver\nScreenplay by \tChanning Gibson\nStory by \tJonathan Lemkin\nAlfred Gough\nMiles Millar\nBased on \tCharacters by\nShane Black\nStarring \tMel Gibson\nDanny Glover\nJoe Pesci\nRene Russo\nChris Rock\nJet Li\nMusic by \tMichael Kamen\nEric Clapton\nDavid Sanborn\nCinematography \tAndrzej Bartkowiak\nEditing by \tFrank J.
