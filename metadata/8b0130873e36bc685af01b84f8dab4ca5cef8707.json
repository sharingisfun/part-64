Next, they find where water is abundant and where it's scarce.\n\nEpisode 2: Mountains\nMountains are the most prominent products of the immense forces which shape the living planet: tectonic drift, volcanic activity and erosion by wind, water, frost and precipitation. We see how wildlife adapts to the harsh, often extreme conditions in various types of mountain ranges, such as Gelada baboons on a suddenly volcano-pushed Ethiopian peek, pumas in the Andes, grizzly bears in the Rockies, snow leopards in the Himalaya.\n\nEpisode 3: Fresh Water\nAlthough merely 3% of water on earth, fresh water plays an important part in the planet's weather and erosion. It is immensely important for all non-marine wildlife, which drinks fresh water and swims, procreates, hunts in it. Its concentrations, such as rivers, lakes and swamps, abound in aquatic and other species, often adapted to 'wet' life.\n\n\nFormat: Matroska\n\nVideo\nFormat / Info: Advanced Video Codec\nSome Encoding settings: qp = 15 / ip_ratio = 1.30 / pb_ratio = 1.30\n\nAudio\nFormat / Info: Digital Theater Systems\nChannel (s): 6 channels\nLanguage: English\n\nText\nFormat: PGS\nCodec ID / Info: The same subtitle format used on BDs / HD-DVDs\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b0130873e36bc685af01b84f8dab4ca5cef8707","amp;dn":"Planet+Earth+SE+2010+Disc1+Blu-ray+720p+x264+DTS-MAXiMiZE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b0130873e36bc685af01b84f8dab4ca5cef8707","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,1,48,135,62,54,188,104,90,240,27,132,248,218,180,202,92,239,135,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
