Their new 'relatives' turn out to be a little more authentically Scottish than they bargained for. Ben Nevis, Laird of Glenbogle Castle, is fiercely protective of his lands and the Macdonald clan spirit, but being cash-strapped he's not above attempts to marry heiress Myrtle to one of his many brawny sons. However, Ben Nevis is distracted when a group of hikers stumble on his moor and spoil a days hunting...sparking all-out war between gentry and commoners.\n\n\nThe author\n\nCompton Mackenzie was born in West Hartlepool in 1883, and educated at St Paul's School and Magdalen College, Oxford. During the First World War he rose to the rank of Captain, and became Director of the Aegean Intelligence Service. He wrote more than ninety books - novels, history and biography, essays and criticism, children's stories and verse, and earned the reputation of being one of the outstanding broadcasters of his time.\n\nTwo of Compton Mackenzie's favourite pastimes were gramophones and Siamese cats - he founded and edited the magazine The Gramophone, and was President of the Siamese Cat Club.
