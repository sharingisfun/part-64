They board a flight to the sunny Gold Coast, where    \n     Alex is waiting for them at the Marriott Resort to reveal their     \n   next challenge. But a free trip is not the only surprise he has in    \n     store - Alex throws the cat among the pigeons when he welcomes      \n     four eliminated designers back into the competition. After the      \n   challenge, one of these contestants will return to the competition    \n      and one of the existing designers will be out. The teams must      \n      create two outfits - one poolside glamour look that includes       \n    swimwear, and a sophisticated evening resortwear piece. To add to    \n   the pressure, Alex comes into the workroom for an unexpected chat.    \n    While his pep talk may be sorely needed, his words stress some of    \n     the designers out, especially Tim, who has nothing to send down     \n        the runway with one hour left. Will he walk away from the        \n   competition rather than send something unfinished down the runway?    \n   Lindy Klim joins the judging panel to help decide who will be back    \n                 in the competition and who will be out.                 \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n            &lt;a href=&quot;
