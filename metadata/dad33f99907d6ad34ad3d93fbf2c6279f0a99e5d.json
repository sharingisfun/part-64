They are normally held in the summer and in the winter each year. During our training camps, we run our normal Boxing, MMA, and Karate classes, plus additional fitness, grappling, and self defense sessions. We always offer various levels of membership (at affordable tuition prices) during our camps, and qualified volunteers may even train for free.Johnston Karate is in the preliminary planning stages for the Martial Arts Training Camp - Summer 2012, at our Karate dojo in Lake City, SC. As such, I have set up a Google+ page specifically for our camps. It is primarily intended as a source of news about our camps, as well as those run by other schools. The ultimate goal is to raise awareness of the positive benefits of not only traditional karate classes, but all types of martial arts training.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.johnstonkarate.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.johnstonkarate.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dad33f99907d6ad34ad3d93fbf2c6279f0a99e5d","amp;dn":"Johnston+Karate+-+Press+Releases%2C+Pictures%2C+and+More","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dad33f99907d6ad34ad3d93fbf2c6279f0a99e5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,211,63,153,144,125,106,211,74,211,217,63,191,44,98,121,240,169,158,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
