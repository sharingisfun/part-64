I have edited out the  \nmusic played during the commercial breaks.\n\nNotes: Glenn is back and live from Israel today.  I've listened to the first hour and so far it sounds like we've missed the Casey Anthony distraction, thankfully.\n\nEither due to his vacation and getting back into the saddle, or due to being in Israel there are a couple of bumps in the road around the commecials - I left them in for your amusement.  :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97f549db9b9e8c104467470ca253c2f20aa25bf8","amp;dn":"Glenn+Beck+2011-07-11+%28Radio+Web+Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97f549db9b9e8c104467470ca253c2f20aa25bf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,245,73,219,155,158,140,16,68,103,71,12,162,83,194,242,10,162,91,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
