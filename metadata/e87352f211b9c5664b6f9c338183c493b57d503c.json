The relation between this type of function theory and the (Newton) potential theory on the Euclidean spaces is well-established. The latter theory has been variously generalized, one example being the axiomatic potential theory on locally compact spaces developed by Brelot, with later ramifications from Bauer, Constantinescu and Cornea. A network is a graph with edge-weights that need not be symmetric. This book presents an autonomous theory of harmonic functions and potentials defined on a finite or infinite network, on the lines of axiomatic potential theory. Random walks and electrical networks are important sources for the advancement of the theory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e87352f211b9c5664b6f9c338183c493b57d503c","amp;dn":"Harmonic+Functions+and+Potentials+on+Finite+or+Infinite+Networks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e87352f211b9c5664b6f9c338183c493b57d503c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,115,82,242,17,185,197,102,75,111,156,51,129,131,196,147,181,125,80,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
