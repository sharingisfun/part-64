The tomboyish Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson) has always considered working class misfit Keith Nelson (Eric Stoltz) her best friend. But when Keith asks out the most popular girl in school, Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson), Watts realizes she feels something much deeper for him. Meanwhile, Hardy Jenns (Craig Sheffer), Amanda\\'s ex-boyfriend from the rich section of town, plans to cause trouble for Keith; though he has no real feelings for Amanda, he feels humiliated at losing her to a social inferior. However, Keith cunningly manages things to his own and Amanda\\'s advantage and gives Hardy his well-deserved comeuppance. In the end, Amanda realizes that she needs time alone and Keith clues into Watts\\'s feelings for him. Realizing that he loves her too, he gives her the diamond earrings he had originally bought as a present for Amanda.\n\nDVD Rip \n\n10/10 quality \n\nEnglish \n\nMore to come.
