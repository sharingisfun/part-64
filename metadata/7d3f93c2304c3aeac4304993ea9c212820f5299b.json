Weak side defenders may come in the pro lane (16'), but not in the college lane (12') for more than three seconds.\nb. Defender on post player is allowed in defensive three-second area (A post player is any player adjacent to paint area).\nc. Player without ball may not be double-teamed from weak side.\nd. Offensive player above foul line and inside circle must be played by defender inside dotted line.\ne. If offensive player is above the top of the circle, defender must come to a position above foul line.\nf. Defender on cutter must follow the cutter, switch, or double-team the ball.\n- After the first illegal defense violation, the clock is reset to 24 seconds. All subsequent violations result in one free throw and possession of the ball. If any violation occurs during the last 24 seconds of each quarter or overtime period, the offended team receives one free throw.\n- If a foul committed by a player calls for a single free throw after a successful field goal in the penalty stage, no additional free throw will be allowed if the first foul attempt is missed.\n- Three free throws to make two; two to make one eliminated.\n- Players must report to the 8-foot box area in front of the scorer's table before referee will beckon them into the game. Players were previously required to report ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œto the scorer.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n- Backcourt fouls considered common fouls and two shots will only be awarded once offending team is over the limit. \n \n\n\n!!!!AFTER DOWNLOAD, PLEASE SEED!!!!
