Its easy to view using notepad etc and can be added to\nfor such problems as clients that are using defective software as often happens with \nselected qbtorrent and even (more rarely) some utorrent clients etc that show no\nprogress regardless of how much you seed them. The software should be smart enough\nto disconnect them - but then who ever said its a genius that wrote utorrent as it\nis! No logic to sharing patterns whatever! Simply insane!\n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\n\n\nSimply place this file in your utorrent applications data directory (under \ndocuments and settings) for the relevant user configuration for XP\n(Or search for the existing file and over-write it if desired)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57406bbd3b88290228a01d727b74f5830d2565c4","amp;dn":"Utorrent+ipfilter.dat+file+-+Asian+countries+August+2011+updates","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57406bbd3b88290228a01d727b74f5830d2565c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,64,107,189,59,136,41,2,40,160,29,114,123,116,245,131,13,37,101,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
