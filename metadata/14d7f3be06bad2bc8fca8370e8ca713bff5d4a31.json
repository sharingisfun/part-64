These 'interrupters' intervene in conflicts before the incidents explode into violence. Their work and their insights are closely entwined with their own personal journeys, which, as each of them points out, defy easy characterisation.\n\nShot over the course of a year by acclaimed filmmaker Steve James, it is a vivid portrayal of a city under siege from spiralling violence, including the brutal murder of Derrion Albert, a Chicago high-school student whose death was caught on videotape.\n\n\nAudio: AC3 [2.0] 192Kbps stream copy\nVcodec: XviD v1.32 (2pass) 720x400\n\nSource: STB-HDR combo (.TS file copied &amp; encoded)\nQuality: Very high\n\nPls help me seed. \n\nEnjoy the viewing &amp; learning.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14d7f3be06bad2bc8fca8370e8ca713bff5d4a31","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Interrupters+-+How+to+Stop+a+Riot+-+Storyville+XviD+AC3.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14d7f3be06bad2bc8fca8370e8ca713bff5d4a31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,215,243,190,6,186,210,188,143,202,131,112,232,202,113,59,255,93,74,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
