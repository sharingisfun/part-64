It works alongside your clipboard - the place things go when you copy or paste them -to hold more data and show you exactly what's going on.\n\nYou can drag-and-drop data to Corkboard, where it will be kept for safekeeping between saves, quits, reboots, and crashes. When you need to use the data again, just drag it back out to the program that needs it. It's fast and easy. And unlike other applications, it doesn't limit you to a list of paragraphs or pictures: Corkboard leaves you free to arrange any data of any type in any way.\n\nYou can also think of Corkboard as Time Machine for your train of thought. We've all made that mistake: cut something important so we can move it, and then accidentally copy something else to the clipboard. It's an unfortunate song we've been dancing to for far too long. Corkboard helps you break the rhythm. Many more features.\n\nWhat's New:\n\n* A splash screen is now presented on first launch and (if the user\n  chooses) subsequent launches with basic instructions on how to use\n  Corkboard.\n\n* Fixed an issue where Corkboard would not ignore &quot;transient&quot; updates\n  from applications like TextExpander.\n\n* Fixed an issue where names in vCards might not display properly if\n  they had default ordering.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nPPC or Intel Mac, OS version: Mac OS X 10.5.8 or late\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cdc0ffd6c4d06ed4b51b4032112a56b94a03166","amp;dn":"Corkboard+v.+2.2+with+Core+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cdc0ffd6c4d06ed4b51b4032112a56b94a03166","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,220,15,253,108,77,6,237,75,81,180,3,33,18,165,107,148,160,49,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
