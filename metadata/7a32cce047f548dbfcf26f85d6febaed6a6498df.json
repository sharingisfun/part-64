The Division is a shadowy government operation devoted to making humankind the ultimate weapon. Those who accept this transformation have the power to move objects with the mind, see the future before it happens, create new realities, and dispense of their enemies without so much as a single touch; those who are unwilling to participate are immediately terminated. Nick Gant (Chris Evans) is a &quot;mover,&quot; a second-generation telekinetic who went into hiding after the Division killed his father more than a decade earlier. He lives a life of anonymity in Hong Kong, a densely populated place where fugitive psychics such as himself are safe as long as they can keep their unique gift secret. Suddenly into Nick's life comes 13-year-old &quot;watcher&quot; Cassie Holmes (Dakota Fanning), a clairvoyant who needs his help in tracking down escaped &quot;pusher&quot; Kira, who may hold the key to bringing down the Division once and for all. A &quot;pusher&quot; is the most powerful kind of psychic due to his or her ability to influence the actions of others by planting thoughts in their minds. Now, as Nick emerges from hiding in order to help Cassie find Kira, the Division's human bloodhounds are hot on their trail. In order to elude the authorities, they'll need to disappear into the seedy underbelly of the city while relying on a team of rogue psychics to help cover their tracks. But Division Agent Henry Carver (Djimon Hounsou) is a powerful pusher who has made it his mission to stop them at all costs, regardless of the collateral damages that may occur in the process. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 51 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 896\n\nFrame Height: 384\n\nFrame Rate: 23fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 159kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a32cce047f548dbfcf26f85d6febaed6a6498df","amp;dn":"Push%282009%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a32cce047f548dbfcf26f85d6febaed6a6498df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,50,204,224,71,245,72,219,252,242,111,133,214,254,186,237,106,100,152,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
