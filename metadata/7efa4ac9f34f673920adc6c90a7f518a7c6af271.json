Some time later (i.e. after the completion of the Aizen arc), Ichigo is living peacefully in the real world when Rukia Kuchiki and Renji Abarai arrive, but refuse to inform Ichigo of the reason for their visit. Shortly after this, Ichigo's school is attacked by a set of powerful, mask-wearing spirits called the Unforgiven (Togabito). When one of the Unforgiven has his mask broken it is revealed that they have escaped from Hell: breaking the mask triggers the appearance of one of the guardians of Hell, a KushanÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½da, who then impales the unmasked Unforgiven and drags him back to Hell.\nUploader Notes:\n===============\n\nFormat: .mkv videos\n\nUse VLC Player for best results.\n\nMy internet speed is slow but I am seeding.
