Despite impossible odds, \n  you must now command a specially outfitted R-GRAY fighter to defend Earth \n  from certain destruction. Each fighter is equipped with lock-on lasers, \n  pulse lasers, and a single devastating assault laser array that can destroy \n  all sighted targets at once. Even with this technology at your disposal, \n  the battle will not be easy. Earth's forces are depleted, and the merciless \n  hordes of Secilia will settle for nothing less than complete annhilation of \n  Earth. Fortunately, Star command has created two R-GRAY prototypes, \n  so if you need extra firepower, a skilled friend can fly at your side. \n  Whether you fly solo or with a friend, the intense sound, action, \n  and arcade-perfect Hyper-3D visuals will blow you away!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38a19c14abf930b0dd7ffb66032dcc560edcca0e","amp;dn":"Ray_Storm-Razor1911","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38a19c14abf930b0dd7ffb66032dcc560edcca0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,161,156,20,171,249,48,176,221,127,251,102,3,45,204,86,14,220,202,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
