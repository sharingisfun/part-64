It also includes technologies that are designed to improve and repair brain function and allow researchers and clinicians to visualize the brain. Otherwise, it's a futuristic metal/electronica hybrid run by Wulf, who is also the songwriter and producer behind the bands releases. The idea for the band goes a long way back, but it became serious when Transhuman EP was completed in 2007 and released in January 2008. It contained 5 powerful songs filled with sonic soundscapes, simple yet aggressive guitar riffs combined with a lot of synthesizers. Few shows were made to support the release, but the main goal was to create and release a full length album. In 2008 a web-single - The Angst Zeit was released to show people a bit upgraded Neurotech sound and direction. Then - in years of composing, experimenting, failing, learning, and some more failing, the debut album was released in March 2011. Antagonist is a developed vision of Neurotech. Big choruses, choirs, melodies and carefully chosen harmonic content combined with a dense production makes Neurotech move another step in the right direction. Album lyrics are always written from a multi-angle point of view - dealing with topics such as - inner opponents, anxiety and agoraphobia, to nonexistence of a modern identity. With completion of Antagonist, Neurotech looks in to the future again. To be continued.
