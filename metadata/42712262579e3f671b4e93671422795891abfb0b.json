Benjamin Martin, a French-Indian war hero who is haunted by his past, now wants nothing more then to live peacefully on his small plantation, and wants no part of a war with the most powerful nation in the world, Great Britain. Meanwhile, his two eldest sons, Gabriel and Thomas, can't wait to enlist in the newly formed &quot;Continental Army.&quot; When South Carolina decides to join the rebellion against England, Gabriel immediately signs up to fight...without his father's permission.
