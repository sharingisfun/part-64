Shucks, it must be Christmas! This is a rip of the Classic Records 200g vinyl by a fella calls himself Dr. Robert. This is the 16-bit/44.1-kHz version. This is the much-coveted original mix. Sounds really good to me. But does it sounds better than the MFSL CD? Don't make me choose! Well, sounds a little cleaner than the MFSL CD, if you know what I mean. Less grungy. Compare versions of &quot;The Punk Meets the Godfather,&quot; and you'll see what I mean. This version features less bass and more top end, that's for sure. I think I prefer this mastering, though I may change my mind. Decide for yourself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47c16f037c9d2b2a4e090007e2f86ec4578e2b2a","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+Quadrophenia+%281973%29+%5BVINYL%5D+%7B16-44%7D+%7BClassic+200g+Quie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47c16f037c9d2b2a4e090007e2f86ec4578e2b2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,193,111,3,124,157,43,42,78,9,0,7,226,248,110,196,87,142,43,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
