Could the tumor-regulating properties of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcannabinoidsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ someday replace the debilitating drugs, chemotherapy, and radiation that harms as often as it heals?\n     Discover the truth about this ancient medicine as world-renowned scientists in the field of cannabinoid research illustrate their truly mind-blowing discoveries in this feature-length documentary.\n     Using original and archival footage, the film presents controversial but highly convincing evidence that this forbidden herb has healing properties beyond any other plant on the planetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ interacting as it does with the bodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œendocannabinoid systemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to keep us fit and disease-free.\n     ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhat if Cannabis Cured CancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ explains how we are all born with a form of marijuana already in our bodies, and when pot is consumed, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œendocannabinoidsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ inside usÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½along with any cannabinoids we ingestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½fit together like a key in a lock. Thereby promoting the death of cancer cells without harming the bodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s healthy cells.\n     Like the old parable of the beggar who was sitting on a treasure chest but never bothered to look inside, governments and the medical establishment have been slow to realize the miraculous anti-cancer properties of marijuana. Finally, in this extraordinary documentary, the truth comes out.\n     A powerful and eye-opening film about the future of cannabisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and perhaps even the future of medicine. Written and directed by BBC filmmaker Len Richmond. Narrated by Emmy-winning actor Peter Coyote. Featuring interviews with...\n     * Dr. Robert Melamede, Associate Professor and Biology Chairman, University\nof Colorado\n     * Dr. Sean D. McAllister, PhD, researcher at the California Pacific Medical\nCenter, San Francisco.\n     * Dr. Jeffrey Hergenrather, M.D.\n     * Dr. David Bearman M.D.\n     * Dr. Manuel Guzman, Ph.D. Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Biology Complutense University Madrid, Spain\n     * Dr. Raphael Mechoulam, Professor of Medical Chemistry at the University of Jerusalem\n     * Dr. Donald Abrams, Professor of Clinical Medicine and Integrative Oncology, University of California, San Francisco\n\n&quot;What if Cannabis Cured Cancer summarizes the remarkable research findings of recent years about the cancer-protective effects of novel compounds in marijuana.  Most medical doctors are not aware of this information and its implications for prevention and treatment. If we need more evidence that our current policy on cannabis is counterproductive and foolish, here it is. An excellent film. &quot;\n\n                                             -Andrew Weil, M .D\n\n\n&quot;A hugely important film.&quot;\n          -Julie Holland, M.D. NYU School of Medicine\n\n\n&quot;What If Cannabis Cured Cancer brings to light a host of recent findings that have potentially game-changing implications for the future of marijuana as a medicine.
