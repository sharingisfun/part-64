It is nearly impossible to find torrent files that include all the extras or even important commentaries. These files are from my collection of DVDs that I have made from rented movies over the last seven years or so. Nearly all of them have been put onto a DVD5, so unfortunately I do not have an uncompressed source handy.  That said I can assure you that these look GREAT on larger screens. I chose to make them this size for economy as DVD9s were $3 each when I started this and DVD5s were .25 cents each. Now I am working on putting some of the best ones on a hard drive to be played with my HD TV Media Player and am still thinking economy is the best rule as these are half the size of ripping a DVD9. This is the best quality for the value.\n\nI would love some productive feedback  . . .   :)\n\nThis is a DVD rip to an ISO so you can watch it on your media player, mount it to a virtual drive or burn it to a DVD.\n\nThis file includes EVERYTHING the original DVD has:\n\n1950\n112 minutes\nBlack and White\n1.37:1\nSpoken Language: English\nSubtitles: English, French, Spanish\n\nIntroduction by John Huston\nAudio commentary: Drew Casper with James Whitmorer\nTheatrical Trailer\n\nAwards\nAcademy Award\nBest Writing nominee \nBest Director nominee: John Huston \nBest Supporting Actor nominee: Sam Jaffe \nBest Cinematography Black and White nominee \n\nBAFTA\nBest Film nominee \n\nGolden Globe Awards\nBest Director (Motion Picture) nominee \n\nSYNOPSIS:  \nNominated for four Academy Awards and long considered a noir classic, John Hustons heist film follows a band of criminal masterminds (Sam Jaffe, Sterling Hayden and Louis Calhern) as they carry out a million-dollar jewelry-store burglary that will have them set for life. Snatching the loot is easy, but their greed soon leads to double crosses and murder. The film features an early appearance by Marilyn Monroe as a sexy moll.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5255c7e061868d552a4dfae703a9f384f198141c","amp;dn":"The+Asphalt+Jungle+%281950%29+FULL+DVD+%28ISO%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5255c7e061868d552a4dfae703a9f384f198141c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,85,199,224,97,134,141,85,42,77,250,231,3,169,243,132,241,152,20,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
