Fred is able to make\n\neverything come to life.\n\nThe late Fred Dibnah was a modern renaissance man. For not only did Fred say how something\n\nwas built in times gone by, he would show the viewer, using exquisite drawings that he had\n\nexecuted himself, models or full-scale replicas, how the techniques had actually been\n\nemployed by master craftsmen of times gone by.\n\nEpisodes 1 and 2: The Art of Castle Building and Might Cathedrals.\n\nHe explains how the castles were designed, how they were constructed, how they were managed\n\nand also, using a technique that Fred still used, how they could be taken during a siege.\n\nFredÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s description of how the cathedrals were made (complete with working scale models of\n\nMedieval construction techniques) is not only interesting but also somewhat moving, too. An\n\ninteresting aside was that Fred was able to show carpenterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s marks on wood that were used to\n\nensure that beams fitted into beams. A sobering thought that the master carpenter who made\n\nthose marks has been dead for 1,000-odd years. Yet his work is still a testament to his\n\nskills, brought to life by Fred Dibnah.\n\n\nEpisodes 3 and 4: The Age of the Carpenter and Scottish Style.\n\n\nThe age of the carpenter describes how the skills of the carpenter really came into their\n\nown during the time of the Tudor great houses, when newly-wealthy merchants decided that\n\nthey required a grand house for their family, suitable to their new status. Fred also\n\npointed out some of the problems in these houses caused by faulty construction techniques.\n\nHe also showed how these are being put right by using modern engineering solutions.\n\nScottish Style covers what was basically the Adams style. Fred Dibnah examines examples of\n\nwhat became known as Scottish Baronial style. He takes the viewer round Glamis Castle,\n\npointing out how a relatively straightforward stone structure was transformed into the\n\nwonderful structure that we see today, by using teams of master stonemasons. The plasterwork\n\nin the castle was executed by experts from Italy. Of particular note the violin, skilfully\n\ncreated out of a mould and plaster. As Fred discovered the tale that the plaster violin was\n\na real violin, dipped in plaster was not right. The true story was much more interesting.\n\nAnd Fred has a reasonably successful go at plaster work himself.\n\nEpisodes 5 and 6: Building the Canals and Victorian Splendour\n\nHere, of course, Fred Dibnah comes into his own. For this is FredÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s favourite era, I think.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution and then into the times of Victorian Britain.\n\nHe returns home to Bolton to look at what remains of the once-extensive canal system and to\n\nexplain not only how they were constructed (complete with models, of course) but also why\n\nthey were constructed.\n\nIn Victorian Splendour Fred Dibnah takes a look at the fantastic work of Pugin when he was\n\nrequired to rebuild the Palace of Westminster in Medieval style, to match the remains of the\n\npalace. He shows how it was built, and how Big BenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clock tower was constructed and also\n\nreveals that Victorian pennies are still used to help regulate the running of the clock.\n\n\n\nThe specially written music by Elizabeth Parker, is outstanding.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61386576798916b37416a590be70d29ea1a87817","amp;dn":"Fred+Dibnah%5C%27s+Building+of+Britain++%28BBC+2002+-+Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61386576798916b37416a590be70d29ea1a87817","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,56,101,118,121,137,22,179,116,22,165,144,190,112,210,158,161,168,120,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
