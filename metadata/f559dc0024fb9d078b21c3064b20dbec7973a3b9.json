They all come from the twisted mind of Eric Simpson. In these four \\\\\\&quot;true\\\\\\&quot; tales, Simpson explores family, religion, love and loss in truly disconcerting and peculiar circumstances. Degradation: When Peter Lindquist cheats on his wife again and again, he really does it repeatedly. Trapped in a cycle of time, Peter and his lover and wife seek escape. Judgment Sunday: A Pastor holds an entire congregation captive, waiting for someone to publicly confess sexual sin, and a young boy, possibly possessed, thinks he is the culprit. Dog: A missionary discovers God can use him to heal diseases, then is confronted with his grandfather\\\\\\'s wish to heal his dying dog. The Poet: Confronted with the loss of love and his own dark history, a poet traveling across country via Greyhound confronts his own demons.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f559dc0024fb9d078b21c3064b20dbec7973a3b9","amp;dn":"True+Stories","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f559dc0024fb9d078b21c3064b20dbec7973a3b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,89,220,0,36,251,157,7,139,33,195,6,75,32,219,236,121,115,163,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
