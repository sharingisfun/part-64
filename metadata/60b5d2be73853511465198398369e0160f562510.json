Whilst the\nefforts of other musicians from western European countriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½principally perhaps\nGermany and HollandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½have long since staked a claim to international attention,\nthe same isn't true of Switzerland, at least until now. This isn't to suggest\nthat the music on OM's Willisau has any kind of nationalistic aspirations, but\nthere is something singularly compelling about it. Recorded live for Swiss Radio\nDRS, at the festival that gives the disc its title, this is a program that\ncovers aspects of the free as well as dealing in mutant funk and a strain of\nmusical Dadaism.\n\nFor all the ground covered here it's not difficult to see how the program might\nhave been spontaneously conceived as a single entity. The discontinuities\nbetween one part and the nextÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½exemplified most graphically by the break between\n&quot;Part I&quot; and &quot;Part II&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½somehow cohere into a unified whole, the substance of\nwhich is set by the musical personalities of the players involved. Because of\nthis, the fractious nature of Urs Leimgruber's tenor sax on &quot;Part IV&quot; is not so\nmuch accompanied as it is complemented by Christy Doran's guitar shredding,\nwithin that feel of mutant funk. This is one of those touches that ensure a\nsense of fun; something not readily apparent in a lot of the music with which\nthis program might cohabit, and an integral part of the proceedings.\n\nThe stealth and small sounds of &quot;Part V&quot; are in marked contrast with this, but\nthat point about the ground covered comes into its own. The established mood\ncarries over into &quot;Part VI,&quot; but the music is marked not only by restraint, but\nby an obviously shared sense of dynamics. Coherence isn't sacrificed on &quot;Part\nIX&quot; either, where the devices that both Doran and bassist Bobby Burri are\ncredited with come into play. Indeed, the augmentation of the basic\nreeds-guitar-bass-drums quartet that OM represents also amounts to a willful\nsubversion of anything that lineup might imply. As a result, time is not so much\nsuspended as dispensed with, acknowledging a denial of the potency of the\nfleeting moment.\n\nThere can be resolution, however. On &quot;Part XI&quot; the passing moments drip with the\npotency of group interplayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½all refined, even while that funk reemerges, with the\nmusic's flow, such as it is; a mere fancy, before the delights of abstraction\nprove all too seductive in the closing &quot;Part XII.&quot;\n\nMore:\n----- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.intaktrec.ch/rev170-a.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.intaktrec.ch/rev170-a.htm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60b5d2be73853511465198398369e0160f562510","amp;dn":"OM+-+Willisau+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60b5d2be73853511465198398369e0160f562510","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,181,210,190,115,133,53,17,70,81,152,57,131,105,224,22,15,86,37,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
