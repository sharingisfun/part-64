Villas-Boas arrived at Stamford Bridge \nafter a hugely successful season with FC Porto, prompting inevitable comparisons \nwith Jose Mourinho, who led the Blues to back-to-back Premier League titles. \nWest Brom were the only visiting team to claim a league point at Old Trafford last season, \nbut their home record against the Red Devils is less impressive - United have won their last \nseven league games at the Hawthorns. The reigning champions have bolstered their squad \nwith the signings of Ashley Young, Phil Jones and David de Gea, and manager Sir Alex Ferguson \nwill be hopeful of securing a fifth Premier League title in six seasons. There is also another \nchance see all the goals from yesterday's seven games.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fe8095d13975cc6735e5eaff203f505ea791561","amp;dn":"Match+Of+The+Day+-+2+-+14+August+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fe8095d13975cc6735e5eaff203f505ea791561","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,232,9,93,19,151,92,198,115,94,94,175,242,3,245,5,234,121,21,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
