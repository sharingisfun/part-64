What sort of tasks, you ask? Is it vacuuming the carpet starting along the outside walls and working in toward the center? Is it making breakfast sandwiches and wrapping them in foil for you and your co-workers to nosh on during the day? Is it riding a unicycle through a world of perilous flashing neon blocks? Nope, it's a much simpler, more worthy task. MATHS. Write that down in your copy book now. \n\n\n\nLogic game much like Light bot!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f9406eeb7ddd739492ed76420f2978e4e2ff98e","amp;dn":"RobotUnlock.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f9406eeb7ddd739492ed76420f2978e4e2ff98e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,148,6,238,183,221,215,57,73,46,215,100,32,242,151,142,78,47,249,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
