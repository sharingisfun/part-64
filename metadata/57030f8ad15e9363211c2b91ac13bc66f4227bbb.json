It was refreshing that the Director (Kriv Stenders) &amp; the human actors never tried to upstage the true star of the movie Red Dog (Koko), letting him become the focus of the story. \n\nStars: Josh Lucas, Rachael Taylor and Keisha Castle-Hughes\n\nPlease SEED for others to Enjoy! \nCheers, Bubanee\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                   : Base Media / Version 2\nCodec ID                         : mp42\nFile size                        : 898 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 32mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 359 Kbps\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\n\nBit rate                         : 1 100 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1 280 pixels\n\nHeight                           : 544 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.35:1\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nStream size                      : 726 MiB (81%)\nWriting library                  : x264 core 119\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : AC-3 5.1 (6 Channels at 256kbps)\nDuration                         : 1h 32mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57030f8ad15e9363211c2b91ac13bc66f4227bbb","amp;dn":"Red+Dog+2011+BRrip+%5Bx264-AC3-5.1%5D%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57030f8ad15e9363211c2b91ac13bc66f4227bbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,3,15,138,209,94,147,99,33,28,43,145,172,19,188,102,244,34,123,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
