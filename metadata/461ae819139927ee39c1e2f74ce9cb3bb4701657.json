Chapin was also a dedicated humanitarian who fought to end world hunger; his work was a key player in the creation of the Presidential Commission on World Hunger in 1977. In 1987, Chapin was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for his humanitarian work.\n\n\n\nHeads &amp; Tales is the first studio album by the American singer/songwriter Harry Chapin, released in 1972 (see 1972 in music). The album contains Chapin's early signature song &quot;Taxi.&quot;\n\nEarly LP pressings of Heads &amp; Tales featured a die-cut front cover with a square hole in it, allowing the &quot;cover&quot; photo of Chapin (which is actually on an enclosed poster/lyric sheet) to be seen through the hole, creating a three-dimensional effect.\n\nDespite its length of nearly seven minutes, which made the song unwieldy for AM radio airplay, &quot;Taxi&quot; was released uncut as a 45 RPM single, and charted at #24 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\ncd ripped by EAC by creebost,thankyou.\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/07/11/harry-chapin/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:461ae819139927ee39c1e2f74ce9cb3bb4701657","amp;dn":"Harry+Chapin...+Heads+%26+Tales%281972%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"461ae819139927ee39c1e2f74ce9cb3bb4701657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,26,232,25,19,153,39,238,57,193,226,247,76,233,203,59,180,112,22,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
