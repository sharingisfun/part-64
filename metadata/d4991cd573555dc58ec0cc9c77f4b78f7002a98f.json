WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re finally at a point that we can share our plans to bring more stability to Europe.\n\nPresently, the PvP.net service in Europe is supporting hundreds of thousands summoners playing League of Legends at any given time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ orders of magnitude bigger than what a typical massively multiplayer environment supports! And while weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re extremely excited by the enthusiasm and passion that you have all shown for the game, it has presented complications that we have been trying to resolve. Specifically, we want to reduce lengthy login queues at peak hours, eliminate our reliance on New York based overflow servers, and drastically reduce the number of unexpected server outages.\n\nFor these reasons, we have been making preparations to split our European service onto two new platforms: EU West and EU Nordic &amp; East. Once this split is complete, your summoner will only be accessible on the platform that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve landed on. Each of these platforms will be able to support the same number of players as the current European environment, dramatically increasing our service quality and paving the way for future growth.\n\nThat being said, switching over to our new, dual platform setup will be quite the logistical feat. In the coming weeks we will be assigning players to their new platform. We did our best to avoid separating groups of friends, but if you should find yourself unsatisfied with your destination platform, we will be facilitating one free transfer between the two platforms following shortly after the split.  In the meantime, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re putting restrictions in place to improve stability for those already in-game.\n\nIf you have a specific question about the split that hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t been answered here, please visit our European Platform Split FAQ. After a visit there, if you still find that your question wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t answered, please ask us in this thread.\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been quite a journey, summoners of Europe, and weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re excited to be able to bring you a service upgrade that should bring about a lasting resolution to your concerns! Thanks for your patience, and thank you for playing League of Legends.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4991cd573555dc58ec0cc9c77f4b78f7002a98f","amp;dn":"LeagueOfLegends+EU+Nordic+%26+East","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4991cd573555dc58ec0cc9c77f4b78f7002a98f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,153,28,213,115,85,93,197,142,192,204,156,119,244,183,143,112,2,169,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
