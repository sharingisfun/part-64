Uniquely, she has the strength, the stamina, and the smarts of a soldier; these come from being raised by her father (Bana), an ex-CIA man, in the wilds of Finland. Living a life unlike any other teenager, her upbringing and training have been one and the same, all geared to making her the perfect assassin. The turning point in her adolescence is a sharp one; sent into the world by her father on a mission, Hanna journeys stealthily across Europe while eluding agents dispatched after her by a ruthless intelligence operative with secrets of her own (Ms. Blanchett). As she nears her ultimate target, Hanna faces startling revelations about her existence and unexpected questions about her humanity.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f65dcafb2fb01ca6c846239d3d2d878f000b7466","amp;dn":"Hanna.2011.DVD.PAL.ET.FI.FR.HU.IT.NO.RO.ES.Subtitles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f65dcafb2fb01ca6c846239d3d2d878f000b7466","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,93,202,251,47,176,28,166,200,70,35,157,61,45,135,143,0,11,116,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
