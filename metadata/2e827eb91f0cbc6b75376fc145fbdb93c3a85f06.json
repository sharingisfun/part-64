Galbraith is running against a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œculture of corruptionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in the state and will talk to Alex about the economic situation and the bankster plan to bankrupt the states. Mr. Galbraith ran as a Democrat in 1991 and 1995, but left the establishment party because ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthey froze us out of the Party and didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t allow our views to be heard or considered.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ He is convinced neither of the two establishment parties can fix the political problems in the state. \n\nAlex also covers the latest breaking news on Libya and the economy.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
