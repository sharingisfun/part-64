Stossel's blog suggested his show would be extended to two hours and have live analysis of the GOP presidential debates. My DVR did pick up some of this in a Stossel rebroadcast the next day, but the show turned out to be rehashed segments from his Campaign 2012 shows featuring Gary Johnson, Ron Paul, and Herman Cain. Therefore, I will make no listing of it.]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1784e5c8b6cc7e08f88f2a7cf31933665645ea90","amp;dn":"20110811-Stossel-%5BDefending+the+Indefensible%5D-Fox+Business.CF.av","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1784e5c8b6cc7e08f88f2a7cf31933665645ea90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,132,229,200,182,204,126,8,248,143,42,124,243,25,51,102,86,69,234,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
