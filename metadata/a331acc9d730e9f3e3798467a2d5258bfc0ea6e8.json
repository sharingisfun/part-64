A significant element of a powerful IDE is a programmer's editor or code editor. It serves as the core foundation of any IDE. UEStudio is built on the chassis of the renowned UltraEdit. As such, the program's backbone is highly seasoned, stable, and already proven as the defacto standard of text and programmer's editors.\n\nBecause UltraEdit is so powerful, many of our users already use it as an IDE and have provided us feature requests to extend that functionality. Together, we have taken those requests, our own ideas, and the concept of a supercharged IDE and produced what we consider to be a powerful application with new and exciting features such as native support for over 30 popular compilers, integrated CVS version control, built-in class browsing, language intelligence (like Intellisense), project converter, batch builder, and an integrated debugger to name just a few!\n\nPowerful project/solution features\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Visual Studio 6/05 project to UEStudio project conversion\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Integrated compiler support (note: compilers not included with IDE)\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Integrated CVS version control support\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Integrated SVN support\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Support for multiple SVN/CVS modules within a project\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Integrated tag support\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Powerful project manager\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Compiler-specific project templates\n\nApplication building features\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Compile your projects from within UEStudio\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Build/batch build\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Debug\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Integrated debugger support for WinDbg for Microsoft C/C++ applications\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Run your application from within UEStudio\n\nScript toolbar features\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Special PHP/Ruby scripting support\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Run and test your PHP/Ruby scripts from within UEStudio\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» New PHP function checks syntax of all open PHP files\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Parse your PHP/Ruby documents\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Strip comments\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Highlight source\n\nNew features:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Integrated PHP Debugging with Xdebug\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Enhanced CVS support\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» New javascript Lint integration\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» New Quick Open Address Bar\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Improved FTP support\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Scripting access to the clipboard\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Include line numbers in &quot;List lines containing string&quot; dialog\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Enhanced Automatic large file detection\n\nHome page - http://www.ultraedit.com\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a331acc9d730e9f3e3798467a2d5258bfc0ea6e8","amp;dn":"IDM+UEStudio+11.00.0.1011-Linezer0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a331acc9d730e9f3e3798467a2d5258bfc0ea6e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,49,172,201,215,48,233,243,227,121,132,103,162,213,37,139,252,14,166,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
