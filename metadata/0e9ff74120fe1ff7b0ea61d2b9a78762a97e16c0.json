Blue House Painted White\n\n________________________________________\n\nFrom a cover of &quot;Settin' the Woods on Fire&quot; in September 1952 to &quot;Blue House Painted White&quot; in\nAugust of 1962, this four-CD set is a priceless overview of the best part of Porter Wagoner's\ncareer. Disc one features his earliest stuff, most of which is solid honky tonk material sung\nin Hank Williams' style. Most of it disappeared without a trace at the time, but it's all extremely\nenjoyable and shows some of Wagoner's versatility. His own sound, as it developed on the later\nsongs on disc one and all of disc two, is more backwoods, with a strong folk component, but also\nbeautifully harmonized. Wagoner's most striking attribute was the sheer joy evident in his singing\nand playing, whether he was doing a deeply religious number (&quot;What Would You Do&quot;) or a loving\ntribute to Bill Monroe (&quot;Uncle Pen&quot;). He was equally comfortable with bluegrass and also country-blues,\nas is clear from the previously unissued &quot;My Brand of Blues,&quot; where he sounds a lot like Johnny Cash.\nDisc three shows Wagoner working in a smoother, more sentimental and commercial country-pop-oriented\nvein, but as late as 1959, he was still doing wonderfully exuberant numbers. Disc four covers the\nearly '60s, the period during which Wagoner continued to merge the stripped-down country of his roots\nand the smooth Nashville sound. Among the outtakes released for the first time is &quot;Private Little World,&quot;\nfeaturing a killer guitar solo totally unexpected in a romantic number like this. The accompanying book\nis informative, though not as well organized as the usual Bear Family notes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e9ff74120fe1ff7b0ea61d2b9a78762a97e16c0","amp;dn":"Porter+Wagoner+-+The+Thin+Man+from+the+West+Plains%3A+The+RCA+Sess","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e9ff74120fe1ff7b0ea61d2b9a78762a97e16c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,159,247,65,32,254,31,247,176,234,97,210,185,167,135,98,169,126,22,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
