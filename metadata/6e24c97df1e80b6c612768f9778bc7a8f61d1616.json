The satellites are revealed as four visually striking and geologically diverse planetary bodies: Io's volcanic lavas and plumes and towering mountains; Europa's fissured ice surface; the craters, fractures and polar caps of Ganymede; and the giant impact basins, desiccated plains and icy pinnacles of Callisto. Featuring images taken from the recent Galileo mission, this atlas is a comprehensive mapping reference guide for researchers. It contains 65 global and regional maps, nearly 250 high-resolution mosaics, and images taken at resolutions from 500 meters to as high as 6 meters.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 406 pages\n    * Publisher: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (September 13, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0521868351\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0521868358","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e24c97df1e80b6c612768f9778bc7a8f61d1616","amp;dn":"Atlas+of+the+Galilean+Satellites%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e24c97df1e80b6c612768f9778bc7a8f61d1616","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,36,201,125,241,232,11,108,97,39,104,249,119,139,199,168,246,29,22,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
