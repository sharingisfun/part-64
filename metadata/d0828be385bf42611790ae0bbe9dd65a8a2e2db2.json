At least that's how writer and newlywed John comes to describe his blonde lab, Marley, when he takes the puppy home and finds that the fluff-ball has an uncanny ability to eat and/or destroy just about anything. As years go by, John and his wife, Jennifer, contemplate having babies and moving across the country, while Marley grows into 100 lbs. of funny, wild, completely untrainable canine companionship -- as well as one of the most important people in the family. Marley &amp; Me is based on the best-selling autobiographical book by columnist John Grogan. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 55 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 720\n\nFrame Height: 304\n\nFrame Rate: 23fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 159kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0828be385bf42611790ae0bbe9dd65a8a2e2db2","amp;dn":"Marley+and+Me%282008%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0828be385bf42611790ae0bbe9dd65a8a2e2db2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,130,139,227,133,191,66,97,23,144,174,11,190,157,214,90,138,46,45,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
