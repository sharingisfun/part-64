Well, kinda. His first new release since 1982 is basically a Sly Plays Sly tribute album, in which the reclusive funk genius pairs up with classic-rock &quot;friends&quot; (Ray Manzarek, Ann Wilson) to rerecord his greatest hits. The results are spunky, if unnecessary: Why bother with Sly and Jeff Beck's remake of &quot;(I Want to Take You) Higher&quot; when you can listen to the torrid original? Of prime interest are three new songs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a brass-and-organ-driven take on the gospel standard &quot;His Eye Is on the Sparrow&quot; and two originals: the gutbucket funk of &quot;Plain Jane&quot; and &quot;Get Away,&quot; a gorgeous soul vamp with a refrain ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ &quot;Keep singin' that melody!&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ that whets the appetite for a full-fledged Sly comeback.\b\n[img]http://i896.photobucket.com/albums/ac169/pbf99/tr.gif[/img] \n\n01.
