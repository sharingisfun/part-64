In the still of the night three prisoners - Frank Lee Morris, Clarence Anglin, and John Anglin - did the impossible. Desperate and dangerous, they escaped from Alcatraz. Only traces of their bold breakout were found in the frigid San Francisco Bay. The three men were never seen nor heard from again. Until now their fate remained a mystery. Did they survive their bid for freedom or did they lose everything to the San Francisco Bay? Today the Bay Area's own scientists and researchers look for answers. Scientists like Dr. Ralph Cheng, an expert on the Bay's hydrodynamic properties; Tom Belcher, a specialist in underwater investigations; San Francisco Bay Model's Hydraulic Engineer Dan Schoof; record-breaking rough water swimmer Fred Ferroggiaro; and Alcatraz historian Jolene Babyak. Their answers lie beneath Alcatraz.\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1600 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.778:1\nVideo Resolution: 832x464 (16.9)\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 45mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 600 MB\nSource: PDTV\nEncoded by: Harry65","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f513b51ed10018770fb55af0f56d542498fe5691","amp;dn":"National.Geographic.Alcatraz.Breakout.New.Evidence.PDTV.x264.AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f513b51ed10018770fb55af0f56d542498fe5691","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,19,181,30,209,0,24,119,15,181,90,240,245,109,84,36,152,254,86,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
