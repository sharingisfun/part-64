A young woman begins to have visions during which time around her stops and she sees horrific events that are taking place elsewhere. In her visions she keeps seeing a bald man. Her doctor can't figure out what is happening, but a government agent who hears about her visions tries to help her, as he is investigating a plane crash that appears to involve the bald man she keeps seeing.\n\nThis is a rip from the Dutch ex-rental vhs (with burbned in subs), so don't expect any miracles regarding image quality. \n\nI've uploaded this because the movie is very hard to get hold of. As far as I know, it hasn''t been released on DVD anywhere. Some people might want to see it again (http://weblogs.nrc.nl/filmvragen/2006/09/01/vrouw-ei-terrorist/comment-page-1/#comment-1470).\n\nEnjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5c5fcd8a487ff6bd1293ea847b75a062c8fd455","amp;dn":"MIND+OVER+MURDER+%281979%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5c5fcd8a487ff6bd1293ea847b75a062c8fd455","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,197,252,216,164,135,255,107,209,41,62,168,71,183,90,6,44,143,212,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
