Written by Lindsey Davis; Full-cast dramatisation starring Anton Lesser as Falco, with Anna Madeley as Helena Justina; Dramatised by Mary Cutler.\n\nFalco is dispatched to one of the most hostile parts of the Empire to deliver a new standard - an iron hand - to one of the legions. Germania is cold, wet, dismal and full of dark forests inhabited by bloodthirsty barbarians, but Falco has an even bigger problem to worry about: he has forgotten Helena Justina's birthday, and she is being pursued by the Emperor's son Titus Caesar. As Falco makes his way through dangerous territory, he encounters the aftermath of a grisly crime, investigates the case of a missing legate, gets into trouble with a centurion and has a fateful encounter with a Celtic priestess and a giant bull. With the help of his travelling companions - Helena's tribune brother Justinus, redundant barber Xanthus and Helveticus - Falco must try to complete his most deadly mission yet...\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nClick the tag for the other Falco dramatisations!\n-------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dbe3f47846f316dacdd8bb23f7523a9638ea3f8","amp;dn":"Lindsey+Davis+-+The+Iron+Hand+of+Mars+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dbe3f47846f316dacdd8bb23f7523a9638ea3f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,190,63,71,132,111,49,109,172,221,139,178,63,117,35,169,99,142,163,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
