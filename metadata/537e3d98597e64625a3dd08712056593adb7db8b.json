Some of the 19 tunes - especially when Geiss solos on soprano sax - reminded me of some of Paul Winter's efforts. The band breaks up the somewhat similar sound of many of the tunes with a couple rather avant performance-piece activities, such as a piece for six lighters and another for two snaredrummers' stick dance. There are also nature-view video projections on a large screen behind the band for some tracks. Both video imaging and the surround sound mix are first rate.  \n\nTrackList: The Rusty Knight, Once in the Black Forest, The Samurai who decided to die, Six Baguettes, The Stallion's Dream, Memories of Lugnosod, Venin, Blow with the Wind, The Lady from Yonder Hill, One Summer Eve, Sparks, Sunshower, He who walks alone, Sourdos, The Eye of the Dragonfly, Toledo IV, Passion and Pride, Jungle Tune, Lament of the White Goddess (encore)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:537e3d98597e64625a3dd08712056593adb7db8b","amp;dn":"Friedemann+-+The+Concert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"537e3d98597e64625a3dd08712056593adb7db8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,126,61,152,89,126,100,98,90,61,208,135,18,5,101,147,173,183,219,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
