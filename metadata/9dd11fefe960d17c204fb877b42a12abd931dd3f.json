Like in the manga, Curse of the Blood Rubies depicts how Goku meets up with Bulma. During their travel Goku meets Oolong, Yamcha, Puar and finally Master Roshi during his first search for the Dragon Balls.\nThe movie starts with King GurumesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ soldiers destroying the homes and lands of farmers within his kingdom to look for blood rubies. His two main enforcers are Pasta and Bongo, whom he is also tasked with finding the Dragon Balls. Since finding the blood rubies, King Gurmes has fallen under a curse that makes his hunger insatiable. He hopes to wish the curse away with the Dragon Balls. A little girl named Penny decides to go and find help.\nA teenage girl named Bulma is also searching for the Dragon Balls with the help of a Dragon Ball radar. Before she can reach the next ball, she runs into Goku (a young boy with a tail) while heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s carrying home a giant fish. Goku tells Bulma that his grandpa gave him a Dragon Ball before he died. Pasta and Bongo arrive at GokuÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s home and steal his Dragon Ball. They flee in a fighter jet and Bulma and Goku give chase in BulmaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s jet. But they are shot down by Pasta. Later that night, Goku and Bulma are looking for food in the forest when the find Penny, who is being accosted by a large monster. The monster flees when Goku proves his strength by destroying a large tree. Goku chases the monster and it finds itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s true form to be a shape-shifting pig named Oolong. Oolong freaks out when he realizes they have landed in the Desert Bandit YamchaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s territory. Yamcha and his sidekick Puar attack the duo. Goku battles Yamcha but their duel is cut short when Bulma arrives. Yamcha flees because he has a paralyzing fear of beautiful women. Penny tells the others about her peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s plight and how she must find the great Master Roshi.\nThe next day, the team arrives on Master RoshiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s island, but Yamcha has arrived their first and tricked Roshi into thinking Goku is there to steal his shell. To find out whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s telling the truth, Roshi summons the Nimbus Cloud, which only an honest person can ride. Goku successfully rides it and clears his name; Yamcha flees again. Master Roshi also gives Bulma his Dragon Ball, but Pasta and Bongo arrive in a submarine and attack the island. One of BulmaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s two Dragon Balls is stolen and RoshiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s house is destroyed. Angered by the destruction of his house, Roshi uses the Kamehameha to destroy the submarine. Pasta and Bongo flee in an escape jet. Peny asks Roshi to help her defeat King Gurumes, but he declines and assure Penny that Goku and Bulma will be all the help she needs. The journey to King GurumesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ castle and are immediately attacked by the kingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s air force. Bulma is shot down while Goku has an aerial duel with Bongo. Yamcha and Puar also arrive and infiltrate the castle, where they meet up with Bulma, Penny, and Oolong. Yamcha is attacked by Pasta but is unable to fight back because of his phobia of beautiful women, so they flee. Goku defeats Bongo by knocking him through a wall with his power pole. They all end up in King GurumesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ throne room. King GurumesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ curse has turned him into a large, purple monster. He attacks Goku to get the last Dragon Ball. Goku tries the Kamehameha, but it fails. Bulma realizes the other six Dragon Balls are inside GurumesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ stomach, so she throws her Dragon Ball into his mouth. The Eternal Dragon erupts from his mouth and offers to grant one wish. Penny wishes for her land to be peaceful and beautiful again. The dragon removes all the blood rubies and makes the land fertile again. After granting the wish, the dragon vanishes and the Dragon Balls are scattered across the Earth again.\nKing GurumesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ curse is lifted, Yamcha and Bulma decide to date, and Goku begins a journey to find his grandpaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dragon Ball.\n\n\n[b]Movie 2:Dragon Ball: Sleeping Princess in Devil's Castle[/b]\nTwelve year old Goku seeks out Master Roshi to ask to be accepted as a student, while the little monk, Krillin, arrives for the same reason (and uses a porno magazine as a bribe). Roshi sends them on a quest far to the west, where &quot;five mountains stand, called the 'Devil's Hand'.&quot; Inside a castle, there lies the legendary, and beautiful, &quot;Sleeping Princess.&quot; Whoever brings back the Sleeping Princess will become Master Roshi's student. The two boys set out, and Krillin uses all the standard tricks to trip Goku up.\nA little later, Bulma, Oolong, Yamcha, and Puar ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who are on summer vacationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½arrive at Kame House to find Goku. Roshi says that the two boys have gone far to the west for training, so the friends fly in Bulma's Capsule jet to the Devil's Hand. When they near the castle, the jet is attacked by demons, and Bulma is taken to the Castle. The owner of the castle, Lucifer, pretends to treat her as a guest, until it becomes time to awaken the Sleeping Princess. In the meantime, Goku and Krillin fight monsters, and they drop in on Bulma just before the Butler can drain Bulma of her blood through a giant syringe (Bulma's blood is to be used to toast the awakening of the Sleeping Princess). Then, Launch (in her evil, blonde state) arrives to steal the Sleeping PrincessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½which is really a giant jewel. Everyone is captured and encased in a wall of rock.\nIt is the night of a full moon, and the moonlight is used to power the jewel. The moonlight also turns Goku into a Giant Ape, and everyone escapes. They fight Lucifer, and Goku uses the Kamehameha blast to destroy Lucifer's Princess-powered laser cannon (the full-moonlight is to be used to destroy the sun, and begin the Reign of Darkness), and kills Lucifer. The heroes escape, and Krillin acts contrite, but doesn't actually apologize to Goku for his behavior. The two boys return to Kame House with Launch, and Roshi takes them both on as students.\n\n\n[b]Movie 3:Dragon Ball: Mystical Adventure[/b]\nAnother retelling of the Dragon Ball story. This time, young Goku and young Krillin are training with Master Roshi for a World Martial Arts Tournament to be held in the country of Mifan. The Emperor of Mifan, Chiaotzu, is trying to find his lost &quot;Ran Ran.&quot; &quot;Minister&quot; Master Shen has Emperor Pilaf work on a Dragon Radar, takes it from him, and is using it to locate the Dragon Balls. Shen and his brother, Mercenary Tao claim that they'll use the wish from Shenron to locate Ran Ran, but are actually planning, with Tien's help, to kill Chiaotzu and take over the country. General Blue announces that Ran Ran is being held in Shen's room, and is killed by Tao for it. Bora and Upa have located the final Dragon Ball and they take it to Mifan to use it to demand that Mifan's soldiers be forced to leave the land near Korin Tower.\nBora is tricked into entering the Tournament (the winner of the Tournament will be granted one wish by Chiaotzu), and is then killed by Tao. Bulma, Oolong, Launch and Pu-erh are looking for the other six Dragon Balls, so Bulma can wish for a boyfriend. However, when the Dragon Balls are located, they are accidentally dropped to the bottom of the moat surrounding Chiaotzu castle. Tien realizes that he likes Chiaotzu too much, and doesn't kill his friend; instead, he blows away Shen. The story of Blue and Goku entering Penguin village is included, but this time it is Tao and Goku that meet Arale and Goku kills Tao with Arale's help.\nGoku throws the final ball into the moat, and asks Shenron to resurrect Bora.\n\n\n[b]Movie 4:Dragon Ball: The Path to Power[/b]\nGoku is a monkey-tailed boy with superhuman strength and skilled in martial arts, living all alone on Mount Paozu. One day, after he catches a fish to eat, a girl in a car (Bulma) almost hits him. He mistakes the car for a monster and throws it onto its side, but gets shot by Bulma in return. He thinks she's some kind of demon, but she ends up convincing him she's human, even though she doesn't have a tail. He invites her into his house since his dead grandpa always told him to be nice to girls, and there she goes straight for his only keepsake. When they go in the house Goku shows Bulma an orange glowing ball that he thinks is his grandpa. All of a sudden Bulma comes to life and asks if she can have the ball. When Goku protests, she brings out two more &quot;grandpas&quot;, and explains to him the legend of the Dragon Balls and the Eternal Dragon. She offers to let him feel her up to get him to come along, but when that doesn't work, she tells him it'll help him get stronger. He agrees, and off they go.\nLater, in the forest, they are forced to stop because of a bull/ox in the road, who demands the girl. Goku ends up fighting the creature, which turns into a robot, and then a bat. Unfortunately, by then, his five minutes are up, and he turns back into Oolong, the pig. There's no time for apologies though, because Yamcha attacks. He demands all the capsules and money they have, but not before Puar recognizes Oolong and yells at him for his perverted antics at Shapeshifting School. Yamcha fights Goku, and appears to have the upper hand, until Bulma wakes up. This puts him into a state of shock and he is forced to retreat with the help of Puar.\nBulma, Oolong, and Goku are driving northward towards the next Dragon Ball, only to discover a huge metal tower in the distance (Yamcha and Puar, who have been following them, stay in a cave nearby to keep warm). Soldiers come out and &quot;welcome&quot; them to Muscle Tower, and Goku takes them all head on. He manages to enter the tower, only to face Major Metallitron. He finishes him off quickly though, and discovers (to his shock) that Metallitron was a robot. General White of the Red Ribbon Army orders the remaining forces toward Goku, but he plows through them all, up into White's room. White then activates the tower's deadliest creation - Android 8.The android nearly strangles Goku, but refuses to kill him when ordered. As a result, White threatens to detonate the android, but Goku intervenes and saves him. The two make quick friends, with Android 8 explaining that he doesn't believe in fighting or killing. Goku complains that his name is weird, so he nicknames him &quot;Eighter&quot; for short. This ends in a snowball fight between the two while the tied-up forces (including White) look on.\nSome time later, while driving in Oolong's house-wagon, they almost run over (and then almost fall off a cliff because of) Turtle. He explains that he is quite lost, and needs help getting back to the sea. After they bring him there, he says he has a reward which he will bring back with him the next day. So, Oolong, Goku, and Bulma spend the night on the beach. Goku wakes up early in the morning and tries to sleep in Bulma's lap, but freaks out when he removes her panties and discovers her lack of the male genitalia. That morning, Turtle comes back bearing his &quot;reward&quot; -- Master Roshi, the Turtle Hermit. He first tries to summon the Immortal Phoenix for them, but when that fails (it apparently died), he calls forth the Nimbus Cloud. Goku is the only one of the bunch who can ride it, so it becomes his.\nWhile Goku's off on the Nimbus, Bulma discovers that the old man has a Dragon Ball. He offers to let go of it only if she shows him her underwear. She agrees, not knowing she doesn't have any on, and both Roshi and Oolong are pleasantly surprised. She is horrified after she goes in to change and finds her underwear still inside. There is no time for an explanation though, because General Blue of the Red Ribbon Army attacks with a fleet of battleships. When the situation seems just about hopeless, Roshi decides to use his legendary Kamehameha wave. He decimates the entire fleet with it, but Blue then orders his army of submarines to attack. Goku however, manages to learn the Kamehameha himself and destroys a good deal of the subs with it. But just as their situation is looking up, Goku is knocked out by a missile, and Bulma, Yamcha, Oolong, Puar, and Roshi are all captured by Blue's soldiers. The five are carted off to prison near Red Ribbon Headquarters. The next morning, Goku awakens to the beeping of the Dragon Radar. Finding himself alone, he sets out in search of the other six Dragon Balls (Blue, having missed the one on Goku's person, is executed for his failure). Goku fights through legions upon legions of Red Ribbon soldiers, while in the meantime, the others try to make their escape from the prison.\nEventually, they make it out, to discover Goku (carrying a pile of tanks) there to greet them. As Goku fights his way into Red Ribbon HQ, Commander Red and Officer Black retreat with their six Dragon Balls to their last refuge. But when Black hears about Red's true wishÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to become taller, Black shoots him and swears to make the Black Ribbon Army ruler of the world. He brings out the Army's greatest weapon, a giant robot. The robot's beam weapon destroys a huge swath of territory in its path, and nearly kills Goku, until he manages to knock it on its stomach and detonate the cannon. Black and his robot aren't out yet though, and Goku is eventually knocked out. Luckily, Android 8 shows up. He puts everything he has into keeping the robot from killing the boy, but it's pretty clear that he's no match. Parts start to fly off of him, and he lands in a crumpled heap, next to Goku.\nGoku comes to, only to see the android die. Saddened and enraged by Android 8's sacrifice, a new world of power suddenly awakens within Goku, as the ground shakes with his tortured screams. Black makes the mistake of egging him on, and Goku finishes him off with a gigantic Kamehameha. After the dust settles, the Eternal Dragon Shenron is summoned forth, but Bulma and Yamcha realize they don't need their wishes anymore. Goku then offers his own wish instead: to revive Android 8 and remove the bomb inside of him.\n[/i]\n\n[b][color=blue][i]::Trackers::[/i][/color][/b]\n[b][code] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://exodus.desync.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://exodus.desync.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.ilibr.org:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.ilibr.org:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.token.ro:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.token.ro:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://the.illusionist.tracker.prq.to/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://the.illusionist.tracker.prq.to/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nudp://tracker.1337x.org:80/announce\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nudp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce\n\nudp://tracker.1337x.org:80/announce\n[/code][/b]\n[b][color=red]Info Hash[/color]:[i]9DD11FEFE960D17C204FB877B42A12ABD931DD3F[/i][/b] \n\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/ib27JkFlGk59jF.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/i7I2WuoNFHb2K.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/ivWCKvZuo262k.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/iVKBKKEtJhoOv.png[/img]\n\n\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/iyXzMn9tYeK00.gif[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/ibg1o6jMcgIhji.png[/img][/center]\n\nWe are now also on FaceBook.
