From raiding a poaching camp in a remote swamp to encountering human-versus-lion conflict outside a national park, this series studies the continent from the perspective of someone who understands the complexities and challenges of the region firsthand.\n\nA fifth-generation South African, Du Plessis developed his love of African wildlife as a child in the foothills of the Draknsberg Mountains. After earning his business degree in tourism from the University of Pretoria, South Africa, Du Plessis participated in some of the most daring African safaris available. With experience as a game ranger in the Kalahari Desert, Du Plessis has also served as head ranger for various African hotels and is considered a pioneer in starting regular safari adventures across Tanzania.\n\nIn his latest Ultimate Africa adventure, Du Plessis' travels shed light on the conservation issues that are plaguing Africa today. What is behind the growing extinction of some of the world's most exotic animals? How do African primates survive habitat destruction? How do reserves sustain themselves through sport hunting?\n\nFrom the plains of the Serengeti to the jungles of Mahale Mountains, Du Plessis explores these questions and more as each episode of the series presents an insider's look at the conservation and preservation challenges of African wildlife.\n\n\n1)  Rhinos of Ol Pejeta \nJean heads to Kenya to join an operation to mark and relocate 7 endangered rhinos. During the operation he goes off in search of a missing rhino named Millennium.

There he explores wild beaches, and goes off in search of un-habituated gorillas. He also visits Kongou Falls, one of Africa's most spectacular waterfalls, where he learns that Chinese plan to build a hydro electric dam that will completely destroy the falls.\n\n3)  Fugitives of Laikipia \nJean returns to Ol Pejeta where management are forced to deal with problem elephants that use their tusks to break through electrified fence and raid local villagers crops.\n\n4)  Shadows of the Serengeti \nA look at the efforts of the FCF anti-poaching team in the Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania. Outside of professional hunter, few people ever visit Maswa, an area along the Western boundary of the Serengeti. Every year as the wildebeest migration passes through, the poachers move in. FCF will launch a major operation to push the poachers before the Migration heads through.\n\n5)  Journeys into the Bush \nJean takes viewers to some of his favorite spots in Tanzania. From walking elephant to hunting with the Hazabe Bushmen. Jean's trip is put into jeapordy by the eruption of the Ol Doinyo Lengai volcano.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/2950/ultimateafricaseason2sc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/2950/ultimateafricaseason2sc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/230/ultimateafricaseason2sct.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/230/ultimateafricaseason2sct.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/736/ultimateafricaseason2sci.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/736/ultimateafricaseason2sci.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/1420/ultimateafricaseason2scp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/1420/ultimateafricaseason2scp.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img153.imageshack.us/img153/2950/ultimateafricaseason2sc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img153.imageshack.us/img153/2950/ultimateafricaseason2sc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img100.imageshack.us/img100/2950/ultimateafricaseason2sc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img100.imageshack.us/img100/2950/ultimateafricaseason2sc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img100.imageshack.us/img100/736/ultimateafricaseason2sci.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img100.imageshack.us/img100/736/ultimateafricaseason2sci.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img100.imageshack.us/img100/3756/ultimateafricaseason2scq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img100.imageshack.us/img100/3756/ultimateafricaseason2scq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img140.imageshack.us/img140/2950/ultimateafricaseason2sc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img140.imageshack.us/img140/2950/ultimateafricaseason2sc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: h264 ,AVC-1\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio BitRate: 384 kbps\nAudio Streams: 2.0\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 46 min\nNumber Of Parts: 5\nPart Size: 1.4 GB\nSubtitles: none\nRipped by Hukumuzuku\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=African%20Wildlife&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=African%20Wildlife&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=African%20Odyssey&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=African%20Odyssey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Africa%3A%20High%20and%20Wild&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Africa%3A%20High%20and%20Wild&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Wild%20Africa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Wild%20Africa&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  ed2k Links \n\n\n\n\nAdded by &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHukumuzuku&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHukumuzuku&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Ultimate_Africa_Season_2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Ultimate_Africa_Season_2&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16d7cac6d79730e33aab9d87d10e89ca28ffe110","amp;dn":"Discovery+Ultimate+Africa+Season+2+2of5+Lost+World+of+Gabon+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16d7cac6d79730e33aab9d87d10e89ca28ffe110","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,215,202,198,215,151,48,227,58,171,157,135,209,14,137,202,40,255,225,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
