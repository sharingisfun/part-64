ABOUT THE PRODUCER: The Producer is an experienced, award winning documentary filmmaker who, as a child, learned that her father was a member of the secretive cult of Freemasonry. She recalls many arguments between her parents over her father's secret meetings and the exclusion of women from the brotherhood. The Masonic ring that her father wore had been passed down from father to son over the generations. When she asked her father about the meaning of the letter &quot;G&quot; and the compass and square on his ring, she got no response. As an adult, she decided to investigate. That investigation grew into four years of intensive research into the identity and history of the diabolical globalists who she calls the &quot;Ring Of Power&quot;. Their goal is one World Empire and one world ruler. \n\n\nEnd of Liberty\n\nThe United States is no longer the land of the free. Americans live in a system with literally millions of unnecessary government regulations that have destroyed the free market and sent millions of well paying jobs overseas.\n\nAmericans today are constantly watching their speedometers and trying to conform to every little rule, yet there are so many rules that it's impossible for even the most honest and hard-working Americans not to be breaking some type of law on a daily basis.\n\nWe are slaves in a criminal monetary system where the Federal Reserve steals from the middle class through inflation and transfers this wealth to their banker friends on Wall Street. (Excerpt from film)\n\n\nEnemy Image\n\nThe invasion of Iraq was the most closely documented war ever fought. Lasting only 800 hours, it produced 20,000 hours of video, but those images were tightly controlled, producing a monolithic view of combat sanitised and controlled by the Pentagon.\n\nEnemy Image traces the ways us television has covered war, starting with Vietnam in the 1960s and shows how the military has devised ever-improving means of ensuring the American public never again has the real face of combat beamed directly into their living rooms. Comparing footage of Vietnam, including rarely-seen material shot in North Vietnam, to coverage of Iraq and using extensive interviews with veteran war correspondents and news anchors, Mark Daniels demonstrates how television that once revealed the truth is now increasingly used to hide it.\n\n\nTrudell\n\nAt its most basic level, TRUDELL is an eye-opening documentary that challenges belief systems. At its loftiest, TRUDELL will inspire you to reawaken your spirit.\n\nIn the telling of TRUDELL, Rae invested more than 12 years chronicling John Trudell's travels, spoken word, and politics. (The making of the movie, a journey in itself, is as much a story as the finished product. See the production notes.) The film combines archival, convert, and interview footage in a lyrical and naturally stylized manner, with abstract imagery mirroring the coyote nature of Trudell.\n\n\nNote From POTP!\n--------------\n\n\nWell here we go again today POTP brings you a collection of favourite and the best documentaries in my opinion.
