The triumph of Borgia, who became Pope Alexander VI, in the papal conclave enrages his rivals in the College of Cardinals, some of whom decided to plot against him. \nWith the help of his family, Alexander takes on his enemies while striking alliances with other European powers to strengthen his position.\nMeanwhile, Alexander's great rival, Cardinal Della Rovere travels across Italy and France to seek allies to depose the pope. He manages to persuade the King Charles of France to assist him in removing Pope Alexander in exchange for supporting the King's claim to the throne of Naples, an ally of the Borgias through marriage. Season one culminates with Charles and his army, accompanied by Della Rovere, marching to Rome and finally coming to a head with the Borgias.\n\n\n* ENGLISH LANGUAGE WITH PORTUGUESE SUBTITLES\n\n\n\n* enjoy\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE FILES 2011 *","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce9316616e26d6b8b0aef08f060bace23f2ac579","amp;dn":"THE+BORGIAS+-+SEASON+1+-+flv+GLOBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce9316616e26d6b8b0aef08f060bace23f2ac579","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,147,22,97,110,38,214,184,176,174,240,143,6,11,172,226,63,42,197,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
