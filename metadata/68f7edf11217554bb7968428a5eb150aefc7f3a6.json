It is nearly impossible to find torrent files that include all the extras or even important commentaries.\nThese files are from my collection of DVDs that I have made from rented movies over the last seven years or so.\nNearly all of them have been put onto a DVD5, so unfortunately I do not have an uncompressed source handy.  That said I can assure you that these look GREAT on larger screens.\nI chose to make them this size for economy as DVD9s were $3 each when I started this and DVD5s were .25 cents each.\nNow I am working on putting some of the best ones on a hard drive to be played with my HD TV media Player and am still thinking economy is the best rule as these are half the size of ripping a DVD9.\nThis is the best quality for the value.\n\nI would love some productive feedback  . . .   :)\n\nThis is a DVD rip to an ISO; you can watch it on your media player, mount it to a virtual drive or burn it to a DVD.\n\nThis file includes EVERYTHING the original DVD has:\n\n1962\n96 minutes\nBlack and White\nWidescreen 2.35:1\nSpoken Language: Japanese\nSubtitles: English\nTheatrical trailer\n\nSYNOPSIS:  Toshiro Mifune swaggers and snarls to brilliant comic effect in Akira Kurosawas tightly paced, beautifully composed Sanjuro. In this sly companion piece to Yojimbo, jaded samurai Sanjuro helps an idealistic group of young warriors weed out their clans evil influences, and in the process turns their image of a PROPER samurai on its ear. Less brazen in tone than its predecessor but equally entertaining, this classic characters return in a masterpiece in its own right.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68f7edf11217554bb7968428a5eb150aefc7f3a6","amp;dn":"Sanjuro+%281962%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68f7edf11217554bb7968428a5eb150aefc7f3a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,247,237,241,18,23,85,75,183,150,132,40,165,235,21,10,239,199,243,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
