The first is the world in which the humans live, Assiah. The other is the world of demons, Gehenna. Ordinarily, travel between the two, and indeed any kind of contact between the two, is impossible. However the demons can pass over into this world by possessing anything that exist within it. Satan the god of demons, but there's one thing that he doesn't have, and that's a substance in the human world that is powerful enough to contain him!! For that purpose he created Rin, his son from a human woman, but will his son agree to his plans? Or will he become something else...? An exorcist?\n\nVideo Format:     mp4\n=============\n\nEnglish Subs By:  Speedy Joe\n================\n\nUploader Notes:\n===============\n                  The size of the files are very small and anyone will surely think that this is very bad quality. Well, it is not. Speedy Joe's files are all 'mp4' format and so the videos are good even in small files. If you ask me, I would give this a rating of 10 in Audio and 7.5 in Video. For best results, use VLC Player.\n\nMore Information: http://www.animecrazy.net/ao-no-exorcist-anime/\n=================\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.blueexorcist.com/\n=================\n\nPlease Seed...&gt;&gt;\n\nEnjoy...:)\t\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd4d786590472e3e68a0f0c91a02309ccac79efb","amp;dn":"The+Blue+Exorcist+Ep.+1+Eng+Sub%28Speedy+Joe%29%5Bimsourav%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd4d786590472e3e68a0f0c91a02309ccac79efb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,77,120,101,144,71,46,62,104,160,240,201,26,2,48,156,202,199,158,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
