I'm guessing it was written before that turned into mass market industry.\n\nAlan Dean Foster is actually a real writer, with real talent, so this book is worth reading even if you've seen the movie- In fact it will tell you a lot more stuff not told, or only briefly mentioned in the movie, and you get to know the other characters better, besides Ripley. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNovels featuring Pip and Flinx\n\nPhilip Lynx (Flinx) is a fictional character, an adventurous young man with unusual qualities in a series of books set in the &quot;Humanx Commonwealth&quot;.\n\n* For Love of Mother-Not (1983)\n* The Tar-Aiym Krang (1972)\n* Orphan Star (1977)\n* The End of the Matter (1977)\n* Flinx in Flux (1988)\n* Mid-Flinx (1995)\n* Reunion (2001)\n* Flinx\\'s Folly (2003)\n* Sliding Scales (2004)\n* Running from the Deity (2005)\n* Bloodhype (1973)\n* Trouble Magnet (2006)\n* Patrimony (2007)\n* Flinx Transcendent (2009)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpellsinger is a series of fantasy novels written by Alan Dean Foster. At present the series consists of eight books, and although there was a significant gap between the writing of book six and book seven, it seems unlikely that any more will be written.\n\nThese volumes are:\n\nSpellsinger (1983)\nThe Hour of the Gate (1984)\nThe Day of the Dissonance (1984)\nThe Moment of the Magician (1984)\nThe Paths of the Perambulator (1985)\nThe Time of the Transference (1987)\nSon of Spellsinger (1993)\nChorus Skating (1994)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy and seed my friends, SEED !!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d29d029a0fc1c509c864471ddf3c6033116d9750","amp;dn":"The+Alan+Dean+Foster+Audiobook+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d29d029a0fc1c509c864471ddf3c6033116d9750","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,157,2,154,15,193,197,9,200,100,71,29,223,60,96,51,17,109,151,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
