This struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one, and it may be both moral and physical, but it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both.\n-FREDERICK DOUGLASS\n\nContents.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \t19.\nINTRODUCTION\t23.\n\nCHAPTER 1: COLUMBUS AND LAS CASAS \t29.\nThe Diario of Christopher Columbus [October 11-15, 1492]\t30.\nBartotome de Las Casas, Two Readings on the Legacy of Columbus [1542 and 1550] Bartolome de Las Casas, The Devastation of\nthe Indies: A Brief Account 0-542]\t35.\nBartolome de Las Casas, In Defense of the Indians [1550]\t42.\nEduardo Galeano, Memory of Fire [1982]  \t45.\n\nCHAPTER 2: THE FIRST SLAVES\t51.\nThree Documents on Slave Revolts [1720 to 1793]\nAnonymous Letter to Mr. Boone in London [June 24, 1720]  52.\nLetter from Petersburg, Virginia [May 17, 1792]  \t52.\nSecret Keeper Richmond [Unknown] to Secret Keeper\nNorfolk [Unknown] [1793] \t53.\nFour Petitions Against Slavery [1773 to 1777]\n'Felix' [Unknown] Slave Petition for Freedom [January 6, 1773] .54 Peter Bestes and Other Slaves Petition for Freedom\n[April 20, 1773]   \t55.\n'Petition of a Grate Number of Blackes' to Thomas Gage\n[May 25, 1774]\t56.\n'Petition of a Great Number of Negroes' to the Massachusetts\nHouse of Representatives [January 13, 1777]\t57.\nBenjamin Banneker, Letter to Thomas Jefferson [August 19, 1791]  58.\n\nCHAPTER 3: SERVITUDE AND REBELLION\t63.\nRichard Frethorne on Indentured Servitude\n[March 20-April 3, 1623]\t64.\nA True Narrative of the Rise, Progresse, and Cessation of the Late\nRebellion in Virginia, Most Humbly and Impartially Reported by\nHis Majestyes Commissioners Appointed to Enquire into the\nAffaires of the Said Colony [1677]\t66.\n\nProclamation of the New Hampshire Legislature\non the Mast Tree Riot [1734]\t69.\nLetter 'Written by 'William Shirley to the Lords of Trade about the\nKnowles Riot [December 1, 1747]\t69.\nGottlieb Mittelberger, Gottlieb Mittelberger's Journey to\nPennsylvania in the Year 1750 and Return to Germany\nin the Year 1754[1754]\t72.\nAccount of the New York Tenant Riots [Juty 14, 1766]\t76.\n\nCHAPTER 4: PREPARING THE REVOLUTION  \t79.\nThomas Hutchinson Recounts the Reaction to the\nStamp Act in Boston [1765]\t80.\nSamuel Drowne's Testimony on the Boston Massacre\n[March 16, 1770]\t82.\nGeorge Hewes Recalls the Boston Tea Party [1834]\t83.\nNew York Mechanics Declaration of Independence [May 29, 1776].... 86.\nThomas Paine, Common Sense [1776] \t87.\n\nCHAPTER 5: HALF A REVOLUTION\t93.\nJoseph Clarke's Letter about the Rebellion in Springfield\n[August 30, 1774]\t94.\nJoseph Plumb Martin, A Narrative of Some of the Adventures,\nDangers and Sufferings of a Revolutionary Soldier [1830]\t96.\nSamuel Dewees Recounts the Suppression of Insubordination\nin the Continental Army after the Mutinies of 1781 [1844]\t100.\nHenry Knox, Letter to George Washington [October 23, 1786]\t105\n'Publius' Qames Madison], Federalist No. 10 [November 23, 1787]... 107.\n\nCHAPTER 6: THE EARLY WOMEN'S MOVEMENT\t115.\nMaria Stewart, 'An Address Delivered at the African Masonic\nHall, Boston' [February 27, 1833]\t116.\nAngelina Grimke Weld's Speech at Pennsylvania Hall [May 17, 1838] .117.\nHarriet Hanson Robinson, 'Characteristics of the Early\nFactory Girls' [1898]\t121.\nS.
