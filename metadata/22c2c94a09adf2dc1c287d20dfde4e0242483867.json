It is a well documented page of history drenched in blood.\n\tIt is the story of inhuman torture, relieved only by being burned to death. The fires left black, scorched earth covered with the bones and ashes of the martyrs. Some of these victims perpetrated no greater crime than to teach their children ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe LordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s PrayerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in English. But the established church of that day demanded that these criminals pay the ultimate penalty.\n\tIt is the story of a small army of courageous martyrs whose skills provided our English translation. Their endurance kept them undaunted by adversity, and courage remained un-subdued  through their last moments at the stake. These where men like John Wycliff, John Huss, Thomas Bilney, William Tyndale, John Rogers, and a host of others too numerous to mention. Finally, it is the story of the triumph of providence . The most brutal attacks in a conspiracy between nations, plus the motivation of a private force of money-hungry bounty hunters, could not thwart the progress of this divinely ordained pursuance. In fact, wealth accumulated by the established church, intended to terminate the endeavor, actually paid the cost of its production.\n\tWe cannot afford to be ignorant of these facts. This info is a must for every Christian home, and especially for our nation of children who are forced to grow up ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ in the midst of a crooked and perverse generationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22c2c94a09adf2dc1c287d20dfde4e0242483867","amp;dn":"The+story+of+the+English+Bible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22c2c94a09adf2dc1c287d20dfde4e0242483867","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,194,201,74,9,173,242,220,28,40,125,32,223,222,78,2,66,72,56,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
