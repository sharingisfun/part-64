Franklin Hatchett (Chris Tucker) is a fast-talking hustler who runs a small time ticket-scalping business. A TV news story by reporter James Russell (Charlie Sheen) brings Franklin's business to the attention of the police, and he finds himself under arrest. While being transported by police bus from one lock-up to another, Franklin is handcuffed to Raymond Villard (Gerard Ismael), a high-level jewel thief from Europe. Villard's henchmen stage a raid in which they explode the vehicle, killing most of the passengers (including two cops), but freeing their partner. Franklin is able to escape but learns that he's now wanted as a cop killer. Hoping to clear his name, Franklin approaches Russell with a deal -- if he'll hide him from the police and help him prove that he had nothing to do with the deadly explosion, he'll give the reporter an exclusive story, which could help Russell boost his sagging career. Money Talks also features Heather Locklear as Russell's fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Grace, and Paul Sorvino as Grace's father, who is quite impressed by Franklin's story that he's related to Vic Damone. \n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 35 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\nFrame Width: 608\n\nFrame Height: 352\n\nFrame Rate: 59fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 111kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35e7726824d49d145e30bbb4e17b0cb72b9f1906","amp;dn":"Money+Talks%281997%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35e7726824d49d145e30bbb4e17b0cb72b9f1906","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,231,114,104,36,212,157,20,94,48,187,180,225,123,12,183,43,159,25,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
