The original band was founded in 1980, and along with other groups like the now defunct Filarfolket has been a vanguard of the progressive folk music scene in Sweden since the 80's.\n\nThe music is based on a great and tender caring for Swedish Folk music, coupled with refined musical skills. With Terje Isungset from Norway as their new percussion player, Groupa continues towards new goals.\n\nIn the music of Groupa, you will find a composed picture of the Traditions of Yesterday, the whims of today, and the possibilities of tomorrow.\n\nGiving the music freer reins and new colours, they are exerting themselves in the joy of drawing new musical dimensions with instruments such as mouth harp, overtone flutes, viola d'amore, bells, stones, wood, and melodeon.\n\nEver since the start, Groupa has been a very popular live band. The band tours Sweden, Scandinavia and Europe relentlessly, and have appeared at the following festivals: Roskilde Festival - Denmark, Folk Festival in Dranouter - Belgium, Nordic Roots Festival, Minneapolis - USA, Folk Alliance, Vancouver - Canada, Pontardawe and Wadebridge - UK, Leipzig Tanzhausfest, Rudolstadt Folk Festival and folkBaltica - Germany, Violin and Village Festival in Maramures - Romania, Festival Porta in Riga - Latvia, Haapavesi Folk Festival - Finland, Falun Folk Music Festival, Stockholm Water festival, Urkult vid NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤mforsen, Hultsfredstestivalen, KorrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ - Sweden and many others.\n\nGroupa has also been touring India.\n\nIn 1987 Groupa received the Volkkunstpreis F V S zu Hamburg, and in 1991 they were awarded a Grammy for their album MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥nskratt. The motivation of the jury read: For pulling the old woolly feeling off folk music with a curious smile!\n\nIn 1992, the founder of the band, Mats Eden, was appointed the Composer of the Year at the Musik vid Siljan festival. He was also one of the participant of the Fiddles on Fire tours in -92 and Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­94 in the UK, organized by Folkworks.\n\nGroupa's second Grammy was collected in 1996 for their latest CD Imeland. This time in competition with large-selling artists as Rikard Wolff and Stefan SundstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶m. (groupa.se)\n\n- - -\n\nTwo-time Swedish Grammy winner Groupa releases their seventh album, now with singer Sofia Karlsson as a permanent member joining Mats Eden, Jonas Simonsson, Rickard AstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶m and Terje Isungset to create yet another edition of what many have referred to as Sweden's 'super group of folk music. Fjalar is freer and imbued with great curiosity, exploring the most primitive Swedish sounds with an exciting, forward-looking energy that once again redefines the spirit of Nordic music. (cdroots.com)\n\n- - - \n\nGroupa are today already nearly dinosaurs of the Swedish experimental folk scene, having started back in the early 80s. Yet they have not lost any of their experimental creativity on this their seventh album. On Fjalar they offer an impressive cross over between Swedish traditional music, jazz, free style experimental and world music. The Groupa line-up has not changed since their last album Lavalek. While Mats Eden on fiddles and melodeon and Jonas Simonson on flutes and HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rjedalspipa provide the melodic instrumental element, the a bit more chaotic element is provided in particular by the innovative and crazy Norwegian percussionist Terje Isungset with his most unusual set of all sorts of percussion instruments, and Rickard AstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶m adds his piano and synthesizer. The latest addition to the Groupa line-up is the young singer Sofia Karlsson, with a singing style that crosses traditional Swedish singing and Free Jazz.\nThe album offers a rather broad range of music, ranging from beautiful quiet music and wild nergetic yet melodic songs and tunes to jazzy trad songs and simply rhythmic noise. There are several genius moments on this CD, such as parts of the first track Det brinner en eld with impressive vocal combinations. As a whole, the album is nothing for people looking for musical harmony, as it sometimes tends to go quite a lot towards noice. This is very free folk music of talented and highly improvising musicians. A special CD in its very own right. (Michael Moll)\n\n- - -\n\nDet bÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rjade 1980 och sedan dess har det blivit sju skivor. DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ var Groupa en del i den nya svenska folkmusiken - banden, grupperna som fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ndrade och utvecklade samspelsformerna. Nu ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r det nya gammalt - det finns massor med grupper och stilar som utvecklats ur 1980-talets experimenterande. Men Groupa har under ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ren stÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ndigt ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶verraskat och tagit nya frÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤scha grepp pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ musiken. Fjalar ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r inget undantag. Skivan innehÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ller flera ovÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ntade och bra lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥tar. En sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥dan ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r klaviaturspelaren Rickard AstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ms 1a augusti som verkar vara inspirerad av Bela Bartoks bearbetningar av musik frÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥n Transylvanien. En del i Groupas utveckling ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r att allt mer av materialet ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r komponerat av gruppens medlemmar och utgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ngspunkterna och inspirationen tillÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ts flÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶da in frÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥n olika hÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ll. Jonas Simonsons FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rspel lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ter som en arabisk- irlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ndsk shakuhachi-improvisation. Terje Isungsets Norwegian Mood blir ett slags nordisk square dance fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶r mungiga. Groupa fortsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤tter att tillreda nya rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤tter med ingredienser frÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥n folkmusikens allt stÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rre skafferi - det ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r bra det!\n(Dan Lundberg i SvD)\n\n- - -\n\nGroupa - Fjalar 2002\n(Vaxholm Xource)\n\n 1.
