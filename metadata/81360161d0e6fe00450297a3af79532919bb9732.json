The \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;offering\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, as the ants call the ritual, is a part of their fate. One \nday in spring, when the offering\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s preparation has just been finished, Flik, unliked inventor ant, accidentally \ndrops the whole offered seeds into the river. The grasshoppers come and give the ants a second chance to \ncollect food until fall. Flik sets off to find bugs that are willing to fight the grasshoppers (nobody expects \nhim to succeed anyway) and, due to a double misinterpretation, returns with a circus crew, giving everybody \nnew hope. When the misunderstanding finally gets cleared out, there is only little time left for a new plan, \nwhich has to work, or else...\n\nCast : \nDave Foley\t... Flik (voice)\nKevin Spacey\t...
