Barny lives with her daughter and works correcting tests and feels a great attraction toward her boss Sabine. When the Germans arrive, Barny sends her half-Jewish daughter to live in a farm in the countryside and finds that Sabine's brother has been arrested and sent to a concentration camp. The atheist Barny decides to baptize her daughter to protect her and chooses priest LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©on Morin to discuss with him themes related to religion and Catholicism and LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©on lends books to her. Barny converts to the Catholicism and becomes closer to LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©on, feeling an unrequited desire for him.\n\n\n\nRELEASE DATE....: 07/26/2011\nTHEATRE DATE....: 1961\n\nGENRE...........: Drama\nSOURCE .........: Leon Morin, Priest 1961 BluRay Criterion Collection \n                  1080p AVC LPCM1.0-CHDBits\nViDEO BiTRATE...: x264 @ 16572 Kbps\nFRAME RATE......: 23.976 fps\n\nAudio 1 : Russian Dub\nAudio 2 : French AC3 1.0 448Kbps\n\nSubtitles : English\n\n\nRUNTiME.........: 1:57:43 (h:m:s)\nASPECT RATiO....: 1.659 : 1\nRESOLUTiON......: 1792 X 1080\nENCODER.........: dingxwsimon@CHD\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ef0ec598d148f52aedb9e7426c6c52493ea327c","amp;dn":"Leon.Morin.Priest.1961.BluRay.1080p.AC3.x264-CHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ef0ec598d148f52aedb9e7426c6c52493ea327c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,240,236,89,141,20,143,82,174,219,158,116,38,198,197,36,147,234,50,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
