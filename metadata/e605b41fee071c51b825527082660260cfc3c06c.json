Suddenly, Larry finds himself face-to-face with a frisky T. Rex skeleton, tiny armies of Romans and cowboys and a mischievous monkey who taunts him to the breaking point. But with the help of President Teddy Roosevelt (Williams), Larry may just figure out a way to control the chaos and become a hero in his son's eyes.\n\nBoasting jaw-dropping special effects and laugh-out-loud","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e605b41fee071c51b825527082660260cfc3c06c","amp;dn":"Night+At+The+Museum%5B2006%5Dac3+5.1+xvid-winker-TFRG-1337X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e605b41fee071c51b825527082660260cfc3c06c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,5,180,31,238,7,28,81,184,37,82,112,130,102,2,96,207,195,192,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
