It was also a series of psychological battles waged by its four leaders: Hitler, Stalin, FDR, and Churchill. Based on the book by Simon Berthon and Joanna Potts, this acclaimed documentary series examines WWII from a completely unique perspective. Inter-weaving the leaders' own words with personal recollections and private diaries, it reveals the four warlords as fascinating, flawed, and fully human. &quot;Gripping&quot;-The Times (UK). Narrated by David Morrissey.\n\n\n&quot;Warlords (2005) is a very informative and sometimes amusing documentary mini-series from England that shows how uneasy everything was. Of course, the Allied vs. Axis leaders are obvious, plus we know how Hitler betrayed Stalin as expected. But here are the titles of the shows:\n\n1) Hitler v. Stalin, August 1939 - 1941\n2) Churchill v. Roosevelt, May 1940 - April 1942\n3) Churchill v. Stalin, June 1941 - June 1944\n4) Roosevelt v. Stalin, July 1944 - April 1945\n\nThe &quot;one of these things don't belong here&quot; surprise is #2, that FDR and Churchill had more problems than you hear about. FDR was so pro-Liberal that he questioned the need for a Monarchy and was unhappy with the situation in India, one that Churchill was so pro-Royal about that he openly bashed Gandhi in one of his all-time faux pas. Either way, that chapter/episode makes this set better than most on the subject, though it cannot escape repeating so much documentation on the subject already. Either way, it is worth seeing all the way through at least once and is recommended.&quot;\n- Nicholas Sheffo on www.fulvuedrive-in.com -\n\n\n1)  Hitler vs Stalin, August 1939-June 1941 \nWorld War II was not only a military conflict. It was also a series of private psychological battles waged by the four great leaders: Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill. In these mental duels, the 'warlords' lied, schemed, charmed, flattered and cheated to win. This four-part examination of World War II leadership shows how both Hitler and Stalin were led into enormous delusion; exposes Roosevelt as cautious and suspicious of Churchill; examines the US president's extraordinary attitude towards Stalin; investigates the secret campaign that Churchill waged against Stalin; and reveals how Roosevelt went behind Churchill's back.\n\n2)  Churchill vs Roosevelt, May 1940-April 1942 \nAn examination of the mental battles waged between 20th-century leaders Winston Churchill and Franklin D Roosevelt during the first two years of their relationship. A duel of false promises, evasion and delusion ensued, which was far removed from the more familiar image of friendship and loyalty. World War II was not only a military conflict. It was also a series of private psychological battles waged by the four great leaders: Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill. In these mental duels, the 'warlords' lied, schemed, charmed, flattered and cheated to win.\n\n3)  Churchill vs Stalin, June 1941-June 1943 \nChurchill v Stalin examines the duel between the British and Russian leaders over what kind of Europe would emerge at the end of the war; a duel during which Roosevelt secretly intervened behind Churchill's back to decide the outcome.Warlords is a major four-part history series which reveals an epic untold story of the Second World War: the inside story of the private psychological war waged by the four great 20th century warlords: Churchill, Hitler, Roosevelt and Stalin; told through their own contemporaneous words and the words of those who observed them at the time. While their nations fought a war of weapons, the warlords fought a psychological war of the mind in which they lied, schemed, charmed, flattered and cheated to win. These psychological duels decided the strategy for the greatest battles in history. They were also the epicentre of a seismic shift in world power, from the age of European empires to the age of two ideologically opposed superpowers, with devastating consequences for hundreds of millions of people.\n\n4)  Roosevelt vs Stalin, July 1944-April 1945 \nThe last in the series examines US President Franklin D Roosevelt's policy of giving in to every demand made by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, in the hope of creating a world of peaceful nations - a risky strategy that went disastrously wrong.
