Elizabeth Olsen auditioned twice for the role of Martha, and had to begin filming only two weeks after winning the part.\n\nThe title of the movie appears to be built around two songs by Jackson C. Frank. &quot;Marcy's Song&quot; is performed by John Hawkes' character in the movie. Jackson C. Frank's own rendition of &quot;Marlene&quot; plays during the end credits. \n\nShot over 20 days. \n\n\n\n\ntorrent name\n\n\nMartha Marcy May Marlene (2011) 720p BRrip_scOrp_sujaidr\n\n\n\n\nvideo details\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;3a72535d527a760e140a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 8 frames\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                         : 1h 41mn\nNominal bit rate                 : 852 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                           : 528 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.40:1\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.053\n\naudio details\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                   : HE-AAC / LC\nCodec ID                         : A_AAC\nDuration                         : 1h 41mn\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz / 24.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\n\n\nlanguage                          english\n\nsubtitle                          english\n\nSAMPLE                  :INCLUDED\n\nthanks to the awesome scorp(the best ripper)\n\nuploader\n sujaidr\n\n\n\nPLOT: Martha has run away from an abusive hippie-like cult where she was living as Marcy May for two years. She turns to her sister and brother-in-law who take her in and want to help her. The problem is Martha is having a hard time separating dreams from reality and when haunting memories of her past keep resurfacing, she may need more help than anyone is able to give her.\n\nDirector: Sean Durkin\nStars:             Elizabeth Olsen, Sarah Paulson and John Hawkes\nimdb: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1441326/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1441326/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nscreenshots\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/zsOUd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/zsOUd.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/u4a6E.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/u4a6E.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/fwdhw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/fwdhw.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/pesmt.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/pesmt.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             \n\n                                        TO VISIT MY facebook page to post requests GOOGLE SUJAIDR \n\n\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE MOVIE THEN DO BUY THE ORIGINAL BLURAY/DVD\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8e4399ddecb81e06443ca480d346782d749599d","amp;dn":"Martha+Marcy+May+Marlene+%282011%29+720p+BRrip_scOrp_sujaidr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8e4399ddecb81e06443ca480d346782d749599d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,228,57,157,222,203,129,224,100,67,202,72,13,52,103,130,215,73,89,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
