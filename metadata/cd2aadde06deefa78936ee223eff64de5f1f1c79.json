He is disturbed by them and the fact that they have been comatose for decades with no hope of any cure. When he finds a possible chemical cure he gets permission to try it on one of them. When the first patient awakes, he is now an adult having gone into a coma in his early teens. The film then delights in the new awareness of the patients and then on the reactions of their relatives to the changes in the newly awakened. \n\nDirector: Penny Marshall\nWriters: Oliver Sacks (book), Steven Zaillian (screenplay)\nStars: Robert De Niro, Robin Williams and Julie Kavner\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099077/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099077/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSOURCE .........: Awakenings 1990 1080p Blu-ray AVC DTS-HD MA 5.1\nViDEO BiTRATE...: x264 L4.1 High @ 11405 Kbps\nFRAME RATE......: 23.976 fps\nAUDiO ..........: ENG DTS-HDMA core 5.1CH 1509kbps\nRUNTiME.........: 02:00:41 (h:m:s)\nASPECT RATiO....: 1.846 : 1\nRESOLUTiON......: 1920 X 1040\nSUBTiTLES.......: N/A\nFilE SiZE.......: 10.88G\nENCODER.........: justinsung@CHD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd2aadde06deefa78936ee223eff64de5f1f1c79","amp;dn":"Awakenings.1990.1080p.BluRay.x264-CHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd2aadde06deefa78936ee223eff64de5f1f1c79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,42,173,222,6,222,239,167,137,54,238,34,62,255,100,222,95,31,28,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
