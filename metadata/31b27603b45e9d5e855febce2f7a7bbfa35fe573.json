There's a lot to be done before, and it's the ONLY way I have found to properly play this game on my mac!\n\nIt's an awsome game and that's why I bothered to search everywhere how to install it without resorting to a virtual machine (makes the game so damm slow it's unplayable)... And it's the reason why I made my first torrent and decided to share the solution with you guys!\nNone of this is my doing, everything except for the final instructions were downloaded from somewhere else, and the tricks to make it work are around in forums... So, thank them, not me!\n\n\nI have a MacBook Pro 13&quot;, Spring 2010 model:\n2.4 PCU\n4 GB Ram\nGeForce 320M\n\nand so far, even in huge battles, it plays superbly, with good graphic settings! No lags, no long waits, no bugs (except one small - related to a MouseWrapOverride), but trust me, it's no big thing...\n\nFollow the instructions with caution and time, and you'll be fine!!\n\nAny questions, I'll make sure to answer as best and as soon as I can!\n\n\nHave fun! \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31b27603b45e9d5e855febce2f7a7bbfa35fe573","amp;dn":"Mount_Blade_1134_Dip_Mac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31b27603b45e9d5e855febce2f7a7bbfa35fe573","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,178,118,3,180,94,157,94,133,95,235,206,47,122,123,191,163,95,229,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
