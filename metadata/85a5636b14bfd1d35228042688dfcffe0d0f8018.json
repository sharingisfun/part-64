Version 5.1.3 is mostly bug fixes and minor upgrades to 5.1.2. There have been some significant improvements at the Woof level, such as a close-box on desktop drive icons and faster boot-up. New applications: Default Applications Chooser, Urxvtset. New utilities: picscale, pngoverlay, yad. I decided to stay with SeaMonkey 1.1.18, as 2.2 has a badly broken Composer module. Also, 1.1.18 is smaller and better suited to older hardware -- FlashBlock and AddBlock plugins are included to suit those on dial-up. A couple of projects that have been upgraded in Wary and are worthy of special mention: BaCon and gtkdialog. BaCon is a superb BASIC compiler, and gtkdialog provides sophisticated GUIs for shell scripts.'\nHere is a brief announcement:\nWary is our 'flavour' of Puppy that targets older hardware.

A couple of projects that have been upgraded in Wary and are worthy of special mention: BaCon and gtkdialog. BaCon is a superb BASIC compiler, and gtkdialog provides sophisticated GUIs for shell scripts. Both of these are extremely active projects, with very keen developers and users.\n\nFurther announcement and release notes: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://distro.ibiblio.org/quirky/wary-5.1.3/release-Wary-5.1.3.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://distro.ibiblio.org/quirky/wary-5.1.3/release-Wary-5.1.3.htm&lt;/a&gt; \n\nblog : http://bkhome.org/blog/\nforum : http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/\n\nmd5sum : ba887afece44e6e3c19e0ce9eeeb360c  wary-5.1.3.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85a5636b14bfd1d35228042688dfcffe0d0f8018","amp;dn":"wary-5.1.3.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85a5636b14bfd1d35228042688dfcffe0d0f8018","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,165,99,107,20,191,209,211,82,40,4,38,136,223,207,254,13,15,128,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
