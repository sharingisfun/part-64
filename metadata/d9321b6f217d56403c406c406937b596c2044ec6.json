They often found their attempts to follow up the success in the studio or on\nthe road to be hampered by Staley\\\\\\'s erratic drug-fueled behavior. Ultimately, Alice in Chains failed to maintain a consistent career in the post-grunge music world and limped into the break when Cantrell\nturned its attention to solo projects (which often include contributions from Kinney and Inez) Staley finally succumbed to his grief when he overdosed in April 2002\n\nJerry Cantrell Mike Inez and Sean Kinney reformed and played shows in late 2005 and early 2006 with a variety of guest vocalists including Billy Corgan, Pat Lachman, Wes Scantlin, Maynard James Keenan, Ann\nWilson and Phil Anselmo. In Late 2006 William DuVall joined Alice in Chains as a singer in the band\\\\\\'s reunion concert with Velvet Revolver and ex-Guns N \\\\\\'Roses bassist Duff McKagan. In September 2009 Alice\nin Chains released their first studio album since 1995 album called \\\\\\&quot;Black gives way to the Blue\\\\\\&quot;.\n\nBlack Gives Way To Blue\n\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Gives_Way_To_Blue/)\n\nReleased: September 25, 2009\n\nRecorded: October 23, 2008 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ March 18, 2009 at Studio 606 in Northridge, California\n\nLength: 54:10\n\nLabel: Virgin/EMI\n\nProducer: Nick Raskulinecz, Alice In Chains\n\nTrack Listing\n\nAll songs written by Jerry Cantrell, except where noted.\n\n1. \t\\\\\\&quot;All Secrets Known\\\\\\&quot;   \t  \t4:43\n2. \t\\\\\\&quot;Check My Brain\\\\\\&quot;   \t  \t3:58\n3. \t\\\\\\&quot;Last of My Kind\\\\\\&quot;   \tCantrell, William DuVall 5:53\n4. \t\\\\\\&quot;Your Decision\\\\\\&quot;   \t  \t4:43\n5. \t\\\\\\&quot;A Looking in View\\\\\\&quot;   \tCantrell, DuVall, Sean Kinney, Mike Inez 7:06\n6. \t\\\\\\&quot;When the Sun Rose Again\\\\\\&quot;   \t4:00\n7. \t\\\\\\&quot;Acid Bubble\\\\\\&quot;   \t  \t6:56\n8. \t\\\\\\&quot;Lesson Learned\\\\\\&quot;   \t  \t4:17\n9. \t\\\\\\&quot;Take Her Out\\\\\\&quot;   \t  \t4:00\n10. \t\\\\\\&quot;Private Hell\\\\\\&quot;   \t  \t5:38\n11. \t\\\\\\&quot;Black Gives Way to Blue\\\\\\&quot;   \t3:04\n\nPersonnel\n\nAlice in Chains\n\n    Jerry Cantrell ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Lead and backing vocals, lead guitar\n    William DuVall ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Backing and lead vocals, rhythm guitar\n    Mike Inez ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass, additional backing vocals\n    Sean Kinney ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, percussion\n\nAdditional performers\n\n    Elton John ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano on \\\\\\&quot;Black Gives Way to Blue\\\\\\&quot;\n    Lisa Coleman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vibraphone on \\\\\\&quot;Black Gives Way to Blue\\\\\\&quot;\n    Chris Armstrong ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ tabla on \\\\\\&quot;When the Sun Rose Again\\\\\\&quot;\n    Stevie Black ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ string arrangement, performance, and engineering on \\\\\\&quot;Your Decision\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\&quot;Private Hell\\\\\\&quot;\n\nProduction\n\n    Produced by Nick Raskulinecz and Alice in Chains\n    Recorded by Paul Figueroa with additional engineering by Nick Raskulinecz, assisted by John Lousteau, Martin Cooke, and Kevin Mills\n    Mixed by Randy Staub\n    Mastered by Ted Jensen\n\nSummary\n\n(Amazon.com)\n\nThe new Alice In Chains album Black Gives Way To Blue is the sound of a new beginning of a legendary band returning to life. Right from the album\\\\\\'s powerful and deeply meaningful opener \\\\\\&quot;All Secrets Known\\\\\\&quot;\nthrough its redemptive closing title track, Black Gives Way To Blue-the first new Alice In Chains album in more than 14 years-is not just another rock reunion, but something far more inspiring.\nAlice In Chains in the present tense. No replacements. No substitutions. It does no disrespect to the enduring memory of Alice In Chains\\\\\\' late, great lead singer Layne Staley, to say that for all that he\nbrought to the group\\\\\\'s music in his lifetime, Alice In Chains always was-and always will be-very much a band. So after taking a more than respectful break to mourn the loss of their brother and band\nmate-to heal and explore music individually-the surviving members of Alice In Chains-Cantrell, drummer Sean Kinney and bassist Mike Inez-gradually began to make music again. The band came together for the\nfirst time in 2005 to take part in a benefit for the victims of the tsunami in Indonesia. The following year, Cantrell, Kinney and Inez decided that the time was right for Alice In Chains to reclaim its\nlegacy again on tour. They did so with the help of a new guitarist and vocalist William DuVall, a gifted singer and player in his own right from Atlanta who previously worked with Neon Christ, Comes with\nthe Fall, and as part of Jerry Cantrell\\\\\\'s touring band. As live audiences discovered, DuVall brings a sound and stage presence all his own. Yet when DuVall and Cantrell blend their voices-as Cantrell and\nStaley did so often-there could be little doubt that the spirit of Alice In Chains was once again alive and well. Black Gives Way To Blue is the next step for a group that over the course of their career\nearned multiple Grammy nominations and sold more than 19 million albums worldwide and achieved 11 Top Ten singles. At the same time, the album offers the full, bracing impact of Alice In Chains-a band that\nkept heavy rock exciting at the dawn of the Nineties and helped set the stage for an even grungier Seattle sound-still clearly firing on all cylinders. Recording on Black Gives Way To Blue began in October\nof 2008 at Dave Grohl\\\\\\'s Studio 606 in Northridge and finished at Henson Studios in Hollywood. The band produced the album with Nick Raskulinecz, whose past credits include Foo Fighters and Rush. Black Gives\nWay To Blue combines some classic Alice In Chain textures with a renewed sense of energy and possibility,from the epic and fantastically electric rocker \\\\\\&quot;A Looking In View\\\\\\&quot; to the exquisite and romantic\nballad \\\\\\&quot;Your Decision\\\\\\&quot; to the album\\\\\\'s stunning first single \\\\\\&quot;Check My Brain,\\\\\\&quot; a throbbing rocker in which a band associated with the Pacific Northwest makes a wry and witty observation on working and\nliving in California. Through Black Gives Way To Blue, there is a deep sense of the unique life that this band has lived, of \\\\\\&quot;Lesson Learned,\\\\\\&quot; to borrow the title of another standout track. In the end, the\nalbum offers a kind of shared group autobiography by a band that has survived so much. Together, they are in a way \\\\\\&quot;Last Of My Kind,\\\\\\&quot; to use the title of another album highlight penned by\nJerry Cantrell-long a dominant songwriter within Alice In Chains-with lyrics from DuVall. \\\\\\&quot;Imitations are pale,\\\\\\&quot; DuVall and Cantrell sing together on \\\\\\&quot;Black Gives Way To Blue,\\\\\\&quot; a brand new Alice In Chain\nclassic that really has it all-the brooding hurt, the brute force and the beautiful introspection. Listen closely to Black Gives Way To Blue, and you\\\\\\'ll know right away this is Alice In Chains.
