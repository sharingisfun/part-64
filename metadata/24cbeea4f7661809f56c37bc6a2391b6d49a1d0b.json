Eight years ago, when he was still just 16, on 16th November 2003,the Argentinean turned out for Frank RijkaardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s team in a friendly in Portugal - almost a year before his first official game, against Espanyol in October 2004. \n BarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§a have beaten Porto on every occasion that the two have met in the Champions League, with wins in the 85/86, 93/94 and 99/00 seasons. Terry Venables team won on the away goals rule in the 85/86 European Cup after winning 2-0 at the Camp Nou and losing 3-1 in Portugal the first time the two met in the leading European competition. \n\nA 40-yard screamer from Ronald Koeman in the 1994 one off semi final, together with a brace from Hristo StÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â²ixkov helped the Dream Team to the final in Athens, whilst the last time the two met was in the Group stages six years later, when Van GaalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s team won 4-2 at the Camp Nou, with two goals from Rivaldo and one each from Frank de Boer, and Kluivert. Rivaldo was again on target in the return match, as was Abelardo in the 0-2 win. \n\nNot so lucky in the UEFA Cup \n\n The first time the two teams met in Europe was in the 72-73 season in the UEFA Cup and the Portuguese team won both legs of the tie -0-1 and 3-1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24cbeea4f7661809f56c37bc6a2391b6d49a1d0b","amp;dn":"Uefa+SuperCup+Final+2011.+First+Half","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24cbeea4f7661809f56c37bc6a2391b6d49a1d0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,203,238,164,247,102,24,9,245,108,55,188,106,35,145,182,212,154,29,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
