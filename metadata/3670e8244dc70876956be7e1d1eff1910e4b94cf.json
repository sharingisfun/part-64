Their leader -- who turns out to be an American Special Forces operative -- carries in one of his men, delirious with a serious infection, one that neither Rebecca nor Bobby have encountered before. When another patient comes down with the same infection, the team realize they're dealing with a highly contagious and resistant bacterial strain, with no idea what it is, where it came from or how to stop it from spreading. Colonel Marks is left with no choice but to quarantine the OR, ICU and the recovery room, so that the Role 3 medics are forced to do surgery in the dining hall. Meanwhile, Rebecca accompanies Pedersen off base to the Women's Clinic, where they find a local in dire need of emergency life-saving surgery.\n\nFile extension and size: .MKV ~ 979 MB\nAudio: Korean and Chinese ~ Subtitles: English and Dutch ~ Dutch custom by chillywitch (selectable)\nCategory: Series\nSource: HDTV\nMenu: No ~ Extras: No\nGenre: Drama\nWeblink: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1829891/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1829891/&lt;/a&gt;\nYouTube: \n\nVideo and audio information:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFormat            : Matroska at 3 315 Kbps\nLength            : 980 MiB for 41mn 19s 136ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 2 865 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 720 (1.778) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 384 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3670e8244dc70876956be7e1d1eff1910e4b94cf","amp;dn":"Combat+Hospital+S01E02+%28HDTV+DD5.1+ENG%2BNL+Subs%29+Hornigold+TBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3670e8244dc70876956be7e1d1eff1910e4b94cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,112,232,36,77,199,8,118,149,107,231,225,209,239,241,145,14,75,148,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
