The spirit was said to be extremely wise, and was supposed to have insight in all things. The spirit was also called &quot;the grieving souls spirit&quot;. \n\nThe idea of &quot;NORDAGUST&quot; was basically to use the wistful, bewitching and recklessness of norwegian folk music, and to intergrate this with a form of heavy rock music. With this as a starting point, we have made music from our own impressions and experience. This has of course been done before, but we try hard to find our own expression, with weight on a soulful atmosphere and organic dynamics, above precision and virtuosity.\n\nTrack List:\n01.
