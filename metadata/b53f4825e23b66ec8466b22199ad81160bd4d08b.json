His long road in music initially took him to California where he found work playing piano with Pee Wee Crayton, Lowell Fulsom and Jimmy McCracklin. At 39, Joe was ready to try recording so he hooked up with McCracklin who got Joe into a studio to record several of Joe's hit songs including 'Blue Soul' and 'Life Was Cold'. Joe Jonas at 73, has the voice that demands to be listened to and remains rich, crystal clear and powerful. He's toured the world performing his magic as only Joe can do. Being a master pf the harmonica and a powerful vocalist, Joe has been featured on many compilation blues CD's. Back in Dallas, and with the help of an old friend, Ray Winkler, Joe released the CD 'Hog Wild For The Blues' in 1998. The following year before a 'captive audience' Joe played the notorious Huntsville Prison and with that experience fresh in his mind, he released yet another hit single, 'Juke The Joint'. In 2002, a third CD 'Blue Soul' was released which featured much of Joe's writings along with a gospel song that took Joe back to his childhood. 'We were Southern-Baptist-blue collar church people' Joe would explain. Soon after, Joe was touring Europe and at every stop was greeted by cheering crowds and sold-out concerts all while simultaneously releasing yet another CD titled 'Last Of The Texas Blueman' for Top Cat Records.
