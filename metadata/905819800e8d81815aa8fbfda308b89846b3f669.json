It simply closes specified applications when the VPN connection is down (for example SecureIX or Relakks Service).\n\nIf soft closing of the applications is not possible it will kill the applications the hard way. So make sure to deselect any additional questions of your applications like &quot;do you really want to quit?&quot; when it's shutting down.\n\nYou will find VPNetMon very useful once you've tried it!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:905819800e8d81815aa8fbfda308b89846b3f669","amp;dn":"VPNetMon+v1.2+Cracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"905819800e8d81815aa8fbfda308b89846b3f669","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,88,25,128,14,141,129,129,90,168,251,253,163,8,184,152,70,179,246,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
