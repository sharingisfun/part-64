With this application, Jailbroken\nPS3 Consoles no longer need the assistance of a JIG device in order to get into\nFactory/Service Mode. This means that one will be able to downgrade their consoles with\nease, simply by running a PKG installed to their XMB. Also, this is another way to access\nand play around with Factory/Service mode. Again, this tool has been created using the\nopen source PS1Light and 100% legal code.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:160e5c484158d6db4dcfd7bad0ce2d1ccd3c7325","amp;dn":"%5BPS3%5D+FactoryServiceMode+Tool+v0.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"160e5c484158d6db4dcfd7bad0ce2d1ccd3c7325","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,14,92,72,65,88,214,219,77,207,215,186,208,206,45,28,205,60,115,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
