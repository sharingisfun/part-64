I've noticed a few bugs with Bridge Linux, I thought I would address them before they were an issue. First and most important, pacman gives key errors because of the old pacman.conf file (should sound familiar if you've tried a recent Ubuntu version), here's the fix. Open up /etc/pacman .conf in leafpad as root with &quot;sudo leafpad /etc/pacman.conf&quot; and replace the file's contents with these from pastebin: http://pastebin.com/LE8dNhAJ Second, on the login screen, the hostname is &quot;archbang&quot; if you didn't edit /etc/rc.conf during installation. This was just overlooked on my part, just open up /etc/rc.conf &quot;sudo leafpad /etc/rc.conf&quot; and change the hostname there. Also, you may have noticed the slow performance of pacman downloads. This is due to default mirror selection, all mirrors are uncommented by default. If you want to dramatically speed up pacman, install 'reflector' with &quot;sudo packer -S reflector&quot; and run this command &quot;reflector -l 5 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist&quot;. It will take a while and might not give any output, so be patient, especially if you have a slow connection. If you notice any more bugs, be sure to get a hold of me. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/bridgelinux/files/Xfce/2012.1/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/bridgelinux/files/Xfce/2012.1/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://millertechnologies.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://millertechnologies.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nsha1sum : af815b7bb21eff4ae6563dedf8a37ab74a75aca0  bridge-2012.1.2-i686.iso\nmd5sum : ef1475956cf49192c2e22a13d6060c49  bridge-2012.1.2-i686.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc8572de15f97e43c5a2bd14fd764053e214734e","amp;dn":"bridge-2012.1.2-i686.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc8572de15f97e43c5a2bd14fd764053e214734e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,133,114,222,21,249,126,67,197,162,189,20,253,118,64,83,226,20,115,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
