Maugin, Andrei V. Metrikine, &quot;Mechanics of Generalized Continua: One Hundred Years After the Cosserats&quot; \n S,.,..er | 2010 | ISBN: 1441956948 | 330 pages | PDF | 2.88 MB \n\n In their 1909 publication ThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©orie des corps dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©formables, EugÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ne and FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Cosserat made a historic contribution to materials science by establishing the fundamental principles of the mechanics of generalized continua. The chapters collected in this volume showcase the many areas of continuum mechanics that grew out of the foundational work of the Cosserat brothers.\n The included contributions provide a detailed survey of the most recent theoretical developments in the field of generalized continuum mechanics. The diverse topics covered include: the properties of Cosserat media, micromorphic bodies, micropolar solids and fluids, weakly- and strongly-nonlocal theories, gradient theories of elasticity and plasticity, defect theory, everywhere-defective materials, bodies with fractal structure, as well as other related topics.\n Mechanics of Generalized Continua can serve as a useful reference for graduate students and researchers in mechanical engineering, materials science, applied physics and applied mathematics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f22f7794c3bcbeed5ab109f8b47ca192d2f88599","amp;dn":"Mechanics+of+Generalized+Continua","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f22f7794c3bcbeed5ab109f8b47ca192d2f88599","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,47,119,148,195,188,190,237,90,177,9,248,180,124,161,146,210,248,133,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
