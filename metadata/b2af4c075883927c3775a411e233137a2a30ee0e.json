Dan is building a new platform for the town's traditional nativity scene, but he is the mayor of the town, the platform is being built with city money, and it's on city property. To top things off: Dan is even married to Kristen (Nancy Stafford) the girl both Dan and Mitch liked in high school. The first thing Mitch does is file a legal injunction against the nativity citing separation of church and state. The second thing he does is decide to run for mayor against his main rival Dan; Dan has been the mayor for years. Mitch accuses Dan of forcing his Christianity upon the entire town, then Mitch goes on a rant about the arrogance and hypocrisy of all Christians...\n\nDirector: Helmut Schleppi\n\nStars:          Ted McGinley, Daniel Baldwin and Nancy Stafford\nimdb:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1640116/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1640116/&lt;/a&gt;                                 \n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/7liX3.png[/IMG]\n\nscreenshots\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/etcIQ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/etcIQ.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/NXGJP.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/NXGJP.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/8DuaY.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/8DuaY.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/piWXj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/piWXj.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/wF4BC.png[/IMG]\n\n         to visit my facebook page for requests GOOGLE SUJAIDR\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/FkbPX.gif[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2af4c075883927c3775a411e233137a2a30ee0e","amp;dn":"Christmas+with+a+Capital+C+2011+720p+BRrip_sujaidr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2af4c075883927c3775a411e233137a2a30ee0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,175,76,7,88,131,146,124,55,117,164,17,226,51,19,122,42,48,238,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
