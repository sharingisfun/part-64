The music on the album has a French influence due to Condon's interest in French chanson during its recording. Condon has cited French and Belgian singers Jacques Brel (French-speaking Belgian), Serge Gainsbourg and Yves Montand (Italian/French) as influences.He also expressed interest in French film and culture, claiming this was his original reason for travelling to Europe.[14] The Flying Club Cup was officially released in October 2007. In September 2007 they did a Take-Away Show acoustic video session shot by Vincent Moon. A DVD, Cheap Magic Inside, was shot but quickly sold out; in December 2010, Beirut, BaDaBing, and Blogotheque authorized its dissemination via digital download.\n\n\nAll songs written by Zach Condon, except where noted.\n\n    &quot;A Call to Arms&quot; - 0:18\n    &quot;Nantes&quot; - 3:50\n    &quot;A Sunday Smile&quot; - 3:35\n    &quot;Guyamas Sonora&quot; - 3:31\n    &quot;La Banlieue&quot; - 1:57\n    &quot;Cliquot&quot; (Zach Condon, Owen Pallett) - 3:51\n    &quot;The Penalty&quot; - 2:22\n    &quot;Forks and Knives (La FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªte)&quot; - 3:33\n    &quot;In the Mausoleum&quot; - 3:10\n    &quot;Un Dernier Verre (Pour la Route)&quot; (Zach Condon, Kendrick Strauch) - 2:51\n    &quot;Cherbourg&quot; - 3:33\n    &quot;St. Apollonia&quot; - 2:58\n    &quot;The Flying Club Cup&quot; - 3:05\n\nripped with dbpoweramp","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:601a8eede39ab129926b9bba43f3cbb002cdc01e","amp;dn":"Beriut+The+Flying+Club+Cup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"601a8eede39ab129926b9bba43f3cbb002cdc01e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,26,142,237,227,154,177,41,146,107,155,186,67,243,203,176,2,205,192,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
