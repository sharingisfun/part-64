Queen Of Rain \n\n\nIn 1991, Roxette embarked upon its first global tour, Join the Joyride. The tour lasted a little over a year, played more than 100 dates and sold out to more than a million people. While traveling, Marie Fredriksson and Per Gessle decided to capture the energy of the band by documenting their development on tape. The result, Tourism, is not a compilation of live material. Rather, it's a tour album, complete with some live tracks, some re-mastered material from the late '80s and some newly written, newly recorded songs. Probably Roxette's best overall effort.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 70\nArtist: Roxette\nAlbum: Tourism\nYear: 1992\nGenre: Pop\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb29363f6d880495e4d546f94dd1ef6fa07aaa83","amp;dn":"Roxette+-+Tourism+%5BFLAC-1992%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb29363f6d880495e4d546f94dd1ef6fa07aaa83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,41,54,63,109,136,4,149,228,213,70,249,77,209,239,111,160,122,170,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
