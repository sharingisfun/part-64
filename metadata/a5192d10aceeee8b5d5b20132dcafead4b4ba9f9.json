A.k.a. one half of the successful act 'Double R.E.L', Ariel discovered psytrance and electronic music in the early 90's. His musical background comes from playing the guitar and keyboards, while he is mostly influenced by metal, old school goatrance, oriental music and of course whatever else that makes him tick!\nAs part of Double R.E.L, Ariel has been playing all over the world for the last couple of years, spreading his music and sharing stages with the biggest names of our time, including an unforgettable performance during the Boom Festival 2006. The 9 tracks presented in this masterpiece album, including collaborations with Painkiller, Punchline and more, were carefully selected and crafted in order to reach a maximum of souls with various influences coming from rock, electro, old school goa trance, full power psychedelic trance and more. Dancefloors all over the globe will be 'freezed' and amazed by the sound and the good vibrations coming from Ariel Ram.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5192d10aceeee8b5d5b20132dcafead4b4ba9f9","amp;dn":"Freeze+-+Orchestra+-+2011+%5BPsychedelic+Trance%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5192d10aceeee8b5d5b20132dcafead4b4ba9f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,25,45,16,172,238,238,139,93,91,32,19,45,202,254,173,75,75,169,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
