How far would you go to survive in the most extreme of circumstances? Five strangers awaken to find themselves trapped in an underground dungeon. They soon realize they are the subjects of one man's sadistic experiment to test the depths of a human being's will to survive. As the days go by with no means of escape, their hunger increases as their humanity fades away.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1176252/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1176252/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e45a4b3b0918b49ab6049ad5404e44cda96dbb7","amp;dn":"Hunger+%282009%29+%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e45a4b3b0918b49ab6049ad5404e44cda96dbb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,69,164,179,176,145,139,73,171,96,73,173,84,4,228,76,218,150,219,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
